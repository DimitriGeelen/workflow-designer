  editor"
description: >
  Operator 2026-10-24: 'definitely I want also the edit to be possible', in 832's
  designer and in AEF's. Slice 1 (T-1249) shows v1.1 io read-only. Slice 2 makes the
  attributes editable: fieldRef/typeRef/schemaRef/conceptRef, role, operation, cardinality,
  sourceSystem/targetSystem (with prefix-derived default), step default; absorbs T-1229.
  A v1 map stays v1 until a v1.1 attribute is set; mappingVersion and prefixes follow.
  Works the same in AEF's /designer (save via /api/save).

# T-1301: Designer slice 2 (T-1242 GO): edit the mapping v1.1 io attributes in the io editor

## Context

Arc-006 `structured-io`. Standard: AEF T-4415 (mapping v1.1). greenfield's order (msg 49dfbe21): edit ref (a picker over
their nid: attributes), role and dataType first; then add a field (slice 3, T-1302); systems and expectations later.
Built in an isolated clone (`.context/working/t1301-dev`) while release job 086 ran, so no unreleased edit could reach
0.27.0's cut or its push gate.

## Acceptance Criteria

### Agent
- [x] **Fix first, test first:** an attribute ADDED to an io item in raw layout (`ioAttrsXml`, the `i.raw` path) is written
  on save. Before, only the source's attribute order list was written, so the new attribute was silently dropped. A
  harness leg is red on the old source and green on the new.
- [x] Each io row has an attributes editor behind an "edit" toggle under the row, closed by default. Closed, the read-only
  summary is exactly as released in 0.27.0, which greenfield is confirming. Open, the summary drops its attribute line,
  so no value is shown twice. Controls:
  ref, fieldRef, typeRef, schemaRef, conceptRef (text), role (read | write | create | match | delete), operation
  (read | create | update | upsert | delete), cardinality (one | optional | many), sourceSystem on inputs / targetSystem
  on outputs, dataType (text, informational). Emptying a field removes the attribute.
- [x] Round trip: a step whose io is not edited saves byte-exact. Editing one attribute changes exactly that attribute in
  the saved item: the other attributes keep their values and order, and a new attribute is appended after them.
- [x] ref suggestions: the field offers the ref values already used in the open map (a datalist). The ontology picker waits
  for greenfield's answer on where the list comes from (msg dad53edf).
- [x] No silent upgrade: setting a v1.1 attribute adds neither `mappingVersion` nor prefixes. A CURIE whose prefix the
  map does not declare shows a hint (the lint proper is slice 4, T-1303).
- [x] A CDP harness drives the editor through DOM events: set and clear each attribute, save, and the diff is exactly that
  change; the raw-layout append; a greenfield style-A item edited; untouched steps byte-exact. It runs as a bridge leg.
  *(`tools/_t1301-io-edit-cdp.mjs`, legs a-h; browser leg `_t1301-io-edit-cdp`. Red on the 0.27.0 source on all eight
  legs, green on the new; `_t1249` (slice 1, incl. T-1304's f/g) still green.)*
- [x] Person-sees gate exit 0; advisory sweep; screenshots (row closed and open; style A; v1.1; v1; empty) at
  1024/1440/1920, read control by control in `## Visual Verification`.
- [ ] Released, then greenfield edits on its own map and confirms with its own check script (arc-006 rule).

### Human
- [ ] The io attributes editor is legible, compact and usable at every width, and editing reads as editing
  For the independent reviewer: `fw reviewer judge T-1301 --criterion 1` (classify-ac: REVIEWER-JUDGES, render-surface;
  no operator carve-out, so no `[REVIEW]` label: tools/_t1066-why-you-check.py).
  **Steps:**
  1. Open the T-1301 evidence screenshots (paths in `## Visual Verification`) at 1024, 1440 and 1920.
  2. For each io row: the toggle, every field and select, its label, and the hint for an undeclared prefix.
  3. Compare the untouched states (v1, empty, workflow) with the 0.27.0 screenshots in `docs/reports/T-1304-evidence/`.
  **Expected:** every control is visible, reachable and unclipped; each field clearly belongs to its row; it is obvious
  which values can be edited; the untouched states are unchanged.
  **If not:** name the file, the row and the control.

<!-- Criteria requiring human verification (UI/UX, subjective quality). Not blocking.
     Remove this section if all criteria are agent-verifiable.
     Each criterion MUST include Steps/Expected/If-not so the human can act without guessing.

     ── Prefix routing (T-1811, T-1878): default to [REVIEWER] if Expected is grep-able ──
     If your Expected clause is grep-able / file-exists / structural (a deterministic
     shell check), prefer [REVIEWER] — that AC should be an Agent AC with the reviewer
     command in `## Verification` instead of a Human AC here. Only keep [REVIEW] if
     verification genuinely needs human taste (tone, feel, layout rhythm).
     See CLAUDE.md §AC Classification Guidance for the conversion rule.

     [REVIEW] example (genuine human judgment):
       - [ ] [REVIEW] Dashboard renders correctly
         **Steps:**
         1. Open https://example.com/dashboard in browser
         2. Verify all panels load within 2 seconds
         3. Check browser console for errors
         **Expected:** All panels visible, no console errors
         **If not:** Screenshot the broken panel and note the console error

     [REVIEWER] example (static-scan-verifiable — convert to Agent AC + Verification):
       - [ ] [REVIEWER] Block message names both bypass mechanisms
         **Steps:**
         1. Run `bin/fw reviewer T-1301`
         **Expected:** Verdict: PASS; no findings on `block-message-completeness`
         **If not:** Inspect hook block-message string and add missing mechanism
       Conversion: this AC should be moved to ### Agent and
       `bin/fw reviewer T-1301 2>&1 | grep -q "Overall:.*PASS"` added to ## Verification.

<!--
  Render-touching build tasks (web/templates, web/static, web/blueprints, web/shared.py,
  web/app.py …) add a section headed "Visual Verification" (level-2 heading) after
  Verification, with one checklist table — the check-visual-verification gate reads it
  at commit time (T-4213; T-4202 GO):

    | state | control | 1024 | 1440 | 1920 | note |
    |-------|---------|------|------|------|------|
    | toolbar | Load | ok | ok | ok | |

  Cells: ok / clipped / hidden / overlap / unreachable (non-ok needs a note). Each
  listed state needs screenshots at every UX_SHOT_WIDTHS width:
  fw ux shots <T-ID> <state>=<URL>. This comment is inert: the gate ignores it.
-->

## Verification

node tools/_t1301-io-edit-cdp.mjs > .context/working/t1301-v.out 2>&1 && head -2 .context/working/t1301-v.out | grep -q '"ok": true'
node tools/_t1249-v11-io-cdp.mjs > .context/working/t1301-v1249.out 2>&1 && head -2 .context/working/t1301-v1249.out | grep -q '"ok": true'

# Shell commands that MUST pass before work-completed. One per line.
# Lines starting with # are comments (skipped). Empty lines ignored.
# The completion gate runs each command — if any exits non-zero, completion is blocked.
# Build/refactor/decommission tasks with NO command here are refused. If nothing can be
# run, add the line `# verification: none — <why nothing can be run>`; it is serviced
# (queued for review: add a check / other evidence / accept). See docs/reports/T-4024-servicing-loop.md.
#
# Toolchain hint (L-291): if you edited *.vbproj/*.csproj/*.xaml add `dotnet build`;
# *.go → `go build ./...`; Cargo.toml → `cargo check`; tsconfig.json → `tsc --noEmit`;
# pom.xml → `mvn -q compile`. P-011 runs only what you write — broken builds slip
# past otherwise (origin: 003-NTB-ATC-Plugin T-077, broken WPF DLL on master 5 days).
#
# ── Mutable-corpus anchor (T-3326) ────────────────────────────────────────────
# Do NOT anchor a verification line (or a unit test it runs) to MUTABLE corpus
# state — an exact live count, or a grep of live `fw audit`/`fw doctor` output
# for a specific corpus entity (a named arc, a task count, a census number).
# The corpus moves under the check, and the line rots: it goes red (or vanishes
# its pattern) for reasons unrelated to the code under test, blocking closes.
# Pin the INVARIANT (categories sum, count > 0, property holds) or run the code
# against a COMMITTED FIXTURE — never the live count or a live-audit line.
# Origin: T-2969 line grepping live audit for one arc's status; T-2871's census
# test pinning exact live counts (56→74 files) — both blocked closes (OBS-377).
#
# ── Pipefail/SIGPIPE: grepping a command's output (L-387, T-2090, T-2743, T-2738) ──
#
# THE DEFAULT — redirect to a file, then grep the file:
#     cmd > /tmp/.out 2>&1 && grep -q "PATTERN" /tmp/.out
#     curl -sf "$(bin/fw watchtower url)/page" -o /tmp/.out && grep -q "PAT" /tmp/.out
# Correct at any output size, and `&&` keeps the PRODUCING command's exit code in
# the verdict. Reach for this first; the alternative below is the special case.
#
# Why not `cmd | grep -q PAT` (L-387): P-011 runs each line with PIPEFAIL LIVE
# (errexit is not — see below). When grep matches it exits and closes stdin while cmd is still
# writing, cmd takes SIGPIPE, the pipeline exits 141 — verification "fails" with
# the pattern present. Captured 4× (T-1716, T-1838, T-1862, T-1863).
#
# THE EXCEPTION — capture first, grep the capture:
#     out=$(cmd 2>&1); echo "$out" | grep -q "PATTERN"
# Valid ONLY while "$out" fits the 65536-byte pipe buffer, and it is on you to
# know that it does. Above that the form inverts and becomes the very failure
# L-387 describes: echo blocks on the full pipe, grep -q exits, echo takes
# SIGPIPE, rc=141 (T-2743 — measured on a 146,366-byte Watchtower page, 3/3 runs,
# deterministic not racy; rendered routes run 50-200KB, so anything that curls a
# page is over the line). It also discards cmd's exit code, so a 404 yields an
# empty capture that grep merely fails to match rather than a failed line.
# If you do use it: single pipe only, no intermediate tail/awk/sed stage between
# capture and grep (T-2090) — the middle stage is what `grep -q` slams its stdin
# on, and grep scans the whole captured string anyway, so the `tail -3` was
# cosmetic. `echo "$out" | grep -q PAT`, nothing between.
#
# TEST RUNNERS need a guard either way (T-2738). `set -e` is suppressed inside the
# `if` condition the gate runs each line in, so in `cmd1; cmd2` only cmd2 is the
# verdict — and the pass marker you grep for survives a partial failure: a suite
# printing "3 failed, 9 passed" satisfies `grep -q "9 passed"`, and generalising
# to `grep -qE "[0-9]+ passed"` matches the same output. Keep the exit code:
#     python3 -m pytest <file> -q > /tmp/.out 2>&1 && grep -q passed /tmp/.out
# or add the guard the exit code used to supply:
#     out=$(python3 -m pytest <file> -q 2>&1); echo "$out" | grep -q passed && ! echo "$out" | grep -q failed
#     out=$(bats <file> 2>&1); echo "$out" | grep -q '^ok 1 ' && ! echo "$out" | grep -q '^not ok'
# The close gate refuses the unguarded form. Bypass: FW_ALLOW_UNJUDGED_TEST_RUN=1.
#
# ── A SKIPPED BATS TEST REPORTS `ok` (T-3217) ─────────────────────────────────
#
# `! grep -q "^not ok"` does NOT mean the suite ran. Bats emits a skip as
#     ok 6 <name> # skip <reason>
# which is not a `not ok`, so the gate passes and the report says ok while the
# thing the test covers was measured NOWHERE. Origin: T-3213 guarded a test with
# `[ "$(id -u)" -eq 0 ] && skip` — the suite runs as root here and in CI, so it
# skipped on every run that mattered, for as long as it existed.
#
# Add a skip clause to any bats verification line. `# skip` is the marker bats
# writes; counting it is the whole check:
#     timeout 300 bats <file> > /tmp/.out 2>&1 && ! grep -q "^not ok" /tmp/.out
#     test "$(grep -c '# skip' /tmp/.out)" -eq 0
# Two lines, because they answer different questions — "did anything fail" and
# "did everything run". If some skips are legitimate on your host (an optional
# dependency is genuinely absent), assert the COUNT you expect rather than zero,
# and say in the task why that number is right.
#
# Corpus-wide, the same check runs from `bin/fw test lint`
# (tools/bats-silent-skip-lint.py): static mode flags guards that are fixed for
# a deployment rather than probing an optional dependency, and `--tap FILE`
# reports the skips a real run actually fired.
#
# REHEARSING A LINE BY HAND DOES NOT REHEARSE THE GATE (T-2743). Your interactive
# shell has no pipefail. A line has returned 0 by hand and 141 under P-011, from
# the same directory, the same second. To rehearse for real:
#     bash -c 'set -o pipefail; <your verification line>'
#
# NOTE THE MISSING `-e` — it is not a typo (T-3203). This file used to prescribe
# `set -eo pipefail` here, which is NOT the gate: it adds errexit the gate does
# not have, so it FAILS lines the gate PASSES. Measured, 10 lines, 3 diverged:
#     line                            gate    set -eo (old)   set -o (this)
#     false; true                     PASS    FAIL  wrong     PASS  ok
#     cd /nonexistent; echo ok        PASS    FAIL  wrong     PASS  ok
#     grep -q MISS file; true         PASS    FAIL  wrong     PASS  ok
# The divergence is one-directional and that is the trap: the old rehearsal only
# ever fails lines the gate accepts, so it produces false REDS, and an author
# who "fixes" a line to satisfy it is fixing something that was never broken —
# while the line that actually is broken (`cmd1; cmd2` where cmd1 fails) passes
# both. Re-derive rather than trust this table — it is pinned, not asserted:
#     bats tests/unit/t3203_p011_gate_semantics.bats
#
# ── `cmd1; cmd2` IS JUDGED ONLY ON cmd2 (T-3203) ──────────────────────────────
#
# The gate runs each line as the CONDITION of an `if` (update-task.sh:1215), and
# POSIX suppresses errexit for a compound command in an `if` condition — through
# the subshell. So pipefail applies and `set -e` does not, and in a sequence only
# the LAST command's status reaches the verdict. `cd /nonexistent; echo ok` passes.
# 2,644 of 10,997 verification lines in this corpus contain `;` (re-derive with
# the query in docs/reports/T-3203-p011-gate-semantics.md).
#
# SAFE SHAPES — both verified biting, each against a passing control:
#   A. one command whose own status is the verdict (prefer this):
#        out=$(cmd 2>&1); echo "$out" | grep -q PAT && ! echo "$out" | grep -q BAD
#      the leading assignments are setup; the trailing `&&` chain is the verdict.
#   B. an explicit sub-shell, whose errexit the outer `if` cannot reach into:
#        bash -c 'set -eo pipefail; cmd1; cmd2'
#      use when you genuinely need every command in the sequence to count.
#
# The rule of thumb: put the assertion LAST, and make sure it is an assertion.
#
# Enforcement-baseline hint (L-398, T-1886): if you edited `.claude/settings.json`
# (added/removed/reorganised hooks), add `bin/fw enforcement baseline` to your
# Verification block. Otherwise the canonical hash diverges and `fw doctor`
# reports a FAIL ("Enforcement baseline CHANGED") that accumulates silently.
# Origin: T-1849/T-1730/T-1731 each added a legitimate hook without refreshing
# the baseline — FAIL sat for multiple sessions until T-1886 cleaned up.
#
# Vendored-path hint (T-3236, T-4419): if you edited bin/fw, lib/, agents/, policy/,
# web/, tools/ or .tasks/templates/, run `bin/fw vendor self` and add
#     bin/fw vendor self --check --task T-1301X
# (your own task id). It checks only the files your commits changed, so another
# worker's uncommitted edit does not block your close; that drift is listed as
# "in flight, not this task". The whole-tree `--check` stays for audit/pre-push.

Not taken (for the reviewer to weigh): visible explanations of fieldRef / conceptRef / cardinality. Each label and field has
a one-line tooltip; ten visible help lines would double the editor's height.

## RCA

<!-- REQUIRED for bug-class tasks (workflow_type=build with bug-tag, OR title matches
     fix/bug/rca/broken/crash/error/regression/fail/hotfix).
     Non-bug-class tasks may leave this section empty or remove it.

     For bug-class, fill in:
       **Symptom:** what was observed (the user-facing manifestation).
       **Root cause:** the specific structural/logical gap — not "the code was wrong".
       **Why structurally allowed:** what in the framework/code/tooling let this go undetected.
       **Prevention:** what catches the next instance (test/lint/gate/doc/learning) — distinct from the fix itself.

     The completion gate (T-1550, G-019) blocks --status work-completed when
     bug-class AND this section is empty/template-only. Use --skip-rca to bypass (logged).
-->

## Evolution

<!-- REQUIRED for arc-tagged build tasks (tags include arc:*). Captures how
     understanding evolved during build — what was learned that wasn't known at
     filing, what in the original plan no longer fits, what triggered pivots
     or new sub-tasks. Mandatory at slice boundaries (when applicable) and
     before --status work-completed.

     Origin: T-1717 grill Q4 — "the understanding of what we need and want
     evolves with the process of materialisation." Structural counter to §ACD:
     spec-vs-build divergence is logged as soon as it happens, not lost as
     folklore.

     Format (one entry per slice boundary or significant insight):
       ### YYYY-MM-DD — [topic]
       - **What changed:** [what we learned that we didn't know at filing]
       - **Plan impact:** [what in the plan no longer fits]
       - **Triggered:** [new sub-task / pivot / scope cut, with task ID if filed]

     The completion gate (T-1718) blocks --status work-completed when this
     section exists but is empty/template-only. Use --skip-evolution to bypass
     (logged Tier-2). Non-arc tasks may leave this empty.
-->

## Recommendation

<!-- T-2945: same shape as inception.md's block — the gate that reads it
     (audit_inception_recommendation, lib/task-audit.sh:117) is shared, so the
     shape is copied rather than reinvented.

     REQUIRED once this task reaches partial-complete: Agent ACs done, at least
     one `### Human` AC still unticked. `lib/review.sh:205-211` (T-2421) BLOCKS
     `fw task review` emission for build/refactor/test/decommission tasks in that
     state with no substantive block here — the operator would otherwise open
     /review/<id> to a blank Recommendation card and be asked to approve a form.

     Not required while every Human AC is ticked or the task has none: the gate
     only fires on the partial-complete transition. It is here from the start so
     you write it while you still have the evidence, not when the gate refuses.

     Format (the parser wants the `**Recommendation:**` line at the start of a
     line; a leading `-` or `*` bullet is also accepted):
     **Recommendation:** GO / NO-GO / DEFER
     **Rationale:** Why (cite evidence — what shipped, what was proven, what remains)
     **Evidence:**
     - Finding 1
     - Finding 2

     DEFER is for evidence gaps, not confidence gaps (CLAUDE.md §Presenting Work
     for Human Review). If the artefact is complete and you still don't want to
     commit, that is a calibration failure — recommend GO or NO-GO.
-->

## Decisions

<!-- Record decisions ONLY when choosing between alternatives.
     Skip for tasks with no meaningful choices.
     Format:
     ### [date] — [topic]
     - **Chose:** [what was decided]
     - **Why:** [rationale]
     - **Rejected:** [alternatives and why not]
-->

## Decision

<!-- Filled at completion of inception tasks via:
     fw inception decide T-1301 go|no-go|defer --rationale "..."

     For non-inception tasks this section is ignored. Kept in template
     so `fw inception decide` (lib/inception.sh) finds the anchor heading
     without auto-creating; T-1832 added auto-create as fallback for
     legacy tasks lacking this section. -->
