# T-096: Density setting has no visible effect - investigate and fix

## Context

Operator report 2026-07-05 (screenshot): setting Density to "tight" "does not have any effect". Investigation (Playwright, task-lifecycle): the mechanism WORKS — density changes laneRowYs (tight 2/4/3 rows vs wide 1/2/2) and the next Tidy retargets accordingly (15/15/14 nodes moved). The defect is UX latency: by T-085/PD-044 design the pref never mutates geometry itself, it only changes what Tidy/Clean/drag-snap do NEXT — and nothing in the UI says so or offers the follow-up action, so the setting reads as broken.

## Acceptance Criteria

### Agent
<!-- Criteria the agent can verify (code, tests, commands). P-010 gates on these. -->
- [x] Changing Density or Branch pitch reveals `#view-apply-row` in the View section: "✨ Apply now — Clean layout" button + hint ("they never move nodes by themselves"); hidden again on modal reopen (openSettings resets it; Playwright hiddenOnOpen=true, rowShown=true after change)
- [x] Apply button runs `cleanLayout()` (explicit click — PD-044 intact; grep count 3 = definition + toolbar button + settings apply button)
- [x] Playwright-verified on task-lifecycle: density→tight alone left all node ys byte-identical (prefAloneMoved=false); apply click moved 15 nodes with feedback text; undoTidy restored byte-identically
- [x] Suites green: bridge "31 passed, 0 failed", validator "34 passed, 0 failed", parity "OK:", geometry "24 clean"
- [x] Gallery synced: `diff -q src/aef-workflow-designer.html build/gallery/designer.html`

### Human
<!-- Criteria requiring human verification (UI/UX, subjective quality). Not blocking.
     Remove this section if all criteria are agent-verifiable.
     Each criterion MUST include Steps/Expected/If-not so the human can act without guessing.

     ── Prefix routing (T-1811, T-1878): default to [REVIEWER] if Expected is grep-able ──
     If your Expected clause is grep-able / file-exists / structural (a deterministic
     shell check), prefer [REVIEWER] — that AC should be an Agent AC with the reviewer
     command in `## Verification` instead of a Human AC here. Only keep [REVIEW] if
     verification genuinely needs human taste (tone, feel, layout rhythm).
     See CLAUDE.md §AC Classification Guidance for the conversion rule.

     [REVIEW] example (genuine human judgment):
       - [ ] [REVIEW] Dashboard renders correctly
         **Steps:**
         1. Open https://example.com/dashboard in browser
         2. Verify all panels load within 2 seconds
         3. Check browser console for errors
         **Expected:** All panels visible, no console errors
         **If not:** Screenshot the broken panel and note the console error

     [REVIEWER] example (static-scan-verifiable — convert to Agent AC + Verification):
       - [ ] [REVIEWER] Block message names both bypass mechanisms
         **Steps:**
         1. Run `bin/fw reviewer T-XXX`
         **Expected:** Verdict: PASS; no findings on `block-message-completeness`
         **If not:** Inspect hook block-message string and add missing mechanism
       Conversion: this AC should be moved to ### Agent and
       `bin/fw reviewer T-XXX 2>&1 | grep -q "Overall:.*PASS"` added to ## Verification.
-->

- [ ] [REVIEW] Density now visibly does something
  **Steps:**
  1. Open http://192.168.10.107:8834/designer.html?load=rendered/task-lifecycle.bpmn
  2. Open ⚙ Settings, change Density to tight — an "✨ Apply now — Clean layout" button appears below Branch pitch
  3. Click it, close the modal, look at the map
  **Expected:** Rows pack tighter after applying; the hint explains prefs guide Tidy/Clean/drag-snap
  **If not:** Screenshot the settings modal and the map

## Visual Verification

- `.playwright-mcp/t096-apply-affordance.png` — settings modal after switching Density to tight: apply button + hint row visible under Branch pitch; READ and confirmed

## Recommendation

**Recommendation:** GO

**Rationale:** Operator-reported "no effect" was UX latency, not a broken mechanism (density measurably retargets rows: tight 2/4/3 vs wide 1/2/2 on task-lifecycle). Fix surfaces the follow-up action at the moment of change while keeping PD-044 (prefs never mutate geometry; the apply is an explicit click).

**Evidence:**
- Playwright: prefAloneMoved=false, apply moved 15 nodes, undo restored byte-identically, row hidden on reopen
- Suites: bridge 31/31, validator 34/34, parity OK, geometry 24 clean; screenshot read

## RCA

**Symptom:** Operator set Density to "tight" in settings and saw no change (screenshot report, 2026-07-05).

**Root cause:** UX latency by design — T-085 density (and T-093 branch pitch) only change what Tidy/Clean/drag-snap target NEXT (PD-044: prefs never mutate stored geometry), but the UI offered no follow-up affordance and no statement of that contract, so the setting read as broken. The underlying mechanism verified working (row counts and Tidy movement change per density).

**Why structurally allowed:** T-085 shipped the pref with a hint describing WHAT it affects but not WHEN; no gate requires deferred-effect settings to surface their apply path. Human ACs on T-085 were reviewed against rendering, not against the "change → expect visible effect" interaction.

**Prevention:** The apply-affordance pattern is now in place for both deferred layout prefs (one shared row, extend for future ones). If a third deferred-effect pref ships without an affordance, register a gap — two instances (density, branch pitch) are covered by this fix.

# Shell commands that MUST pass before work-completed. One per line.
# Lines starting with # are comments (skipped). Empty lines ignored.
# The completion gate runs each command — if any exits non-zero, completion is blocked.
#
# Toolchain hint (L-291): if you edited *.vbproj/*.csproj/*.xaml add `dotnet build`;
# *.go → `go build ./...`; Cargo.toml → `cargo check`; tsconfig.json → `tsc --noEmit`;
# pom.xml → `mvn -q compile`. P-011 runs only what you write — broken builds slip
# past otherwise (origin: 003-NTB-ATC-Plugin T-077, broken WPF DLL on master 5 days).
#
# Pipefail/SIGPIPE hint (L-387): P-011 runs each command under `set -eo pipefail`.
# `cmd | grep -q PATTERN` exits 141 (SIGPIPE) when grep matches and closes stdin
# while the upstream is still writing — verification then "fails" even though
# the pattern was present. Safe pattern: capture first, grep the capture:
#     out=$(cmd 2>&1); echo "$out" | grep -q "PATTERN"
# Or:
#     cmd > /tmp/.out 2>&1 && grep -q "PATTERN" /tmp/.out
# Origin: L-387, captured 4× (T-1716, T-1838, T-1862, T-1863) before this hint.
#
# Single pipe only — no intermediate tail/awk/sed stages between capture and grep
# (T-2090): `echo "$out" | tail -3 | grep -q PAT` re-introduces the SIGPIPE risk
# the capture step closed off — the middle stage is what `grep -q` slams its
# stdin on. `echo "$out"` is small and immediate; grep scans the whole captured
# string anyway, so the tail-3 was cosmetic. Drop it: `echo "$out" | grep -q PAT`.
#
# Enforcement-baseline hint (L-398, T-1886): if you edited `.claude/settings.json`
# (added/removed/reorganised hooks), add `bin/fw enforcement baseline` to your
# Verification block. Otherwise the canonical hash diverges and `fw doctor`
# reports a FAIL ("Enforcement baseline CHANGED") that accumulates silently.
# Origin: T-1849/T-1730/T-1731 each added a legitimate hook without refreshing
# the baseline — FAIL sat for multiple sessions until T-1886 cleaned up.

<!-- REQUIRED for bug-class tasks (workflow_type=build with bug-tag, OR title matches
     fix/bug/rca/broken/crash/error/regression/fail/hotfix).
     Non-bug-class tasks may leave this section empty or remove it.

     For bug-class, fill in:
       **Symptom:** what was observed (the user-facing manifestation).
       **Root cause:** the specific structural/logical gap — not "the code was wrong".
       **Why structurally allowed:** what in the framework/code/tooling let this go undetected.
       **Prevention:** what catches the next instance (test/lint/gate/doc/learning) — distinct from the fix itself.

     The completion gate (T-1550, G-019) blocks --status work-completed when
     bug-class AND this section is empty/template-only. Use --skip-rca to bypass (logged).

## Evolution

<!-- REQUIRED for arc-tagged build tasks (tags include arc:*). Captures how
     understanding evolved during build — what was learned that wasn't known at
     filing, what in the original plan no longer fits, what triggered pivots
     or new sub-tasks. Mandatory at slice boundaries (when applicable) and
     before --status work-completed.

     Origin: T-1717 grill Q4 — "the understanding of what we need and want
     evolves with the process of materialisation." Structural counter to §ACD:
     spec-vs-build divergence is logged as soon as it happens, not lost as
     folklore.

     Format (one entry per slice boundary or significant insight):
       ### YYYY-MM-DD — [topic]
       - **What changed:** [what we learned that we didn't know at filing]
       - **Plan impact:** [what in the plan no longer fits]
       - **Triggered:** [new sub-task / pivot / scope cut, with task ID if filed]

     The completion gate (T-1718) blocks --status work-completed when this
     section exists but is empty/template-only. Use --skip-evolution to bypass
     (logged Tier-2). Non-arc tasks may leave this empty.

## Decisions

<!-- Record decisions ONLY when choosing between alternatives.
     Skip for tasks with no meaningful choices.
     Format:
     ### [date] — [topic]
     - **Chose:** [what was decided]
     - **Why:** [rationale]
     - **Rejected:** [alternatives and why not]

## Decision

<!-- Filled at completion of inception tasks via:
     fw inception decide T-XXX go|no-go|defer --rationale "..."

     For non-inception tasks this section is ignored. Kept in template
     so `fw inception decide` (lib/inception.sh) finds the anchor heading
     without auto-creating; T-1832 added auto-create as fallback for
     legacy tasks lacking this section. -->
