description: >
  Operator request (2026-08-26): add the ability to add or remove segments from a connector, and enhance manual control over routing. Currently edge paths are computed by the router with no operator override. This task determines HOW: the waypoint interaction model, where waypoints persist, and whether operator-set routing survives the round-trip and the T-308/T-358 byte-identity gates. The what is already decided by the operator; this is a design task, not a go/no-go.

# T-599: Manual connector routing: add/remove waypoints and give the operator real control over the path

## Context

Operator request, 2026-08-26, immediately after T-598 landed the source-end arrow:

> "can we now please also add an option to add or remove segments from the connector lines
> And I want to enhance the ability to manual control routing"

Today edge geometry is computed by the router and the operator has no override: the path
is rebuilt on every render, so anything they drag is discarded. The ask is for waypoints
they can insert, move and delete.

**Why this is a design task and not a build.** The interaction is the easy half. The hard
half is that operator-set geometry has to survive three things this project already has
opinions about, and getting any of them wrong makes the feature actively harmful:

1. **Persistence.** T-357 adopted BPMN DI as the designer geometry and retired
   `aef-position`. Waypoints belong in `<di:waypoint>` on the edge's DI element — inventing
   a parallel store would re-create exactly what T-357 retired.
2. **Round-trip and the byte-identity gates.** `_t308-export-byte-identity-cdp.mjs` (24
   maps, currently rc 0) and `_t358-byteid-thirdparty.mjs` (11 third-party, currently rc 1
   with a stated unsound precondition) both compare exported bytes. Emitting waypoints
   changes those bytes for every edge an operator touches — and possibly for edges they
   never touched, if the router starts round-tripping its own computed points. **Measure
   which, before designing the emitter.** T-565 is the cautionary case: an exit condition
   written against a population that could not exercise the change.
3. **Router interaction.** Once an edge has operator waypoints, does the router still get
   to reroute it? A silent reroute that discards manual work is the same class of defect as
   T-341's unresolvable `flowNodeRef` silently reassigning a node. Whatever the answer, it
   must be visible, not implicit.

**Open questions for the design to answer (not for the agent to decide alone):**
- Are waypoints absolute or relative to the endpoints when a node moves?
- Does deleting a node's last manual waypoint restore auto-routing, or leave the edge frozen?
- Does an operator-routed edge show that it is operator-routed? (T-598 just established
  that direction should be readable from the diagram itself.)
- Add/remove interaction: double-click a segment to insert, drag a handle off the path to
  delete? Or explicit affordances?

## Acceptance Criteria

### Agent
- [ ] The waypoint persistence format is specified against BPMN DI (`<di:waypoint>`), with
      an explicit statement of what happens to an edge that has never been manually routed —
      it must not start emitting waypoints merely because the feature exists
- [ ] The byte impact is MEASURED on the real corpus before the emitter is designed: how many
      of the 24 rendered maps and 11 third-party documents change bytes when waypoints are
      emitted, reported per document, not as an aggregate
- [ ] The router-vs-operator precedence rule is written down, including what the operator
      sees when the router would have rerouted an edge they pinned
- [ ] The four open questions above are each answered or explicitly deferred with a reason
- [ ] Build slices are created as separate tasks; no production interaction code lands
      under this design task

### Human
<!-- Criteria requiring human verification (UI/UX, subjective quality). Not blocking.
     Remove this section if all criteria are agent-verifiable.
     Each criterion MUST include Steps/Expected/If-not so the human can act without guessing.

     ── Prefix routing (T-1811, T-1878): default to [REVIEWER] if Expected is grep-able ──
     If your Expected clause is grep-able / file-exists / structural (a deterministic
     shell check), prefer [REVIEWER] — that AC should be an Agent AC with the reviewer
     command in `## Verification` instead of a Human AC here. Only keep [REVIEW] if
     verification genuinely needs human taste (tone, feel, layout rhythm).
     See CLAUDE.md §AC Classification Guidance for the conversion rule.

     [REVIEW] example (genuine human judgment):
       - [ ] [REVIEW] Dashboard renders correctly
         **Steps:**
         1. Open https://example.com/dashboard in browser
         2. Verify all panels load within 2 seconds
         3. Check browser console for errors
         **Expected:** All panels visible, no console errors
         **If not:** Screenshot the broken panel and note the console error

     [REVIEWER] example (static-scan-verifiable — convert to Agent AC + Verification):
       - [ ] [REVIEWER] Block message names both bypass mechanisms
         **Steps:**
         1. Run `bin/fw reviewer T-XXX`
         **Expected:** Verdict: PASS; no findings on `block-message-completeness`
         **If not:** Inspect hook block-message string and add missing mechanism
       Conversion: this AC should be moved to ### Agent and
       `bin/fw reviewer T-XXX 2>&1 | grep -q "Overall:.*PASS"` added to ## Verification.

## Verification

# Shell commands that MUST pass before work-completed. One per line.
# Lines starting with # are comments (skipped). Empty lines ignored.
# The completion gate runs each command — if any exits non-zero, completion is blocked.
#
# Toolchain hint (L-291): if you edited *.vbproj/*.csproj/*.xaml add `dotnet build`;
# *.go → `go build ./...`; Cargo.toml → `cargo check`; tsconfig.json → `tsc --noEmit`;
# pom.xml → `mvn -q compile`. P-011 runs only what you write — broken builds slip
# past otherwise (origin: 003-NTB-ATC-Plugin T-077, broken WPF DLL on master 5 days).
#
# ⚠ ERREXIT WARNING (T-352) — READ BEFORE USING THE CAPTURE PATTERN BELOW.
# P-011 runs each command under `-o pipefail` but NOT under an effective `-e`.
# Measured, not assumed (tools/_t352-p011-errexit-probe.sh): the gate runs each line as
# `if ( … eval "$cmd" ); then` (update-task.sh:1018) and that subshell is the CONDITION
# of an `if`, which neutralises errexit inside it. pipefail survives; errexit does not.
# CONSEQUENCE: a line of the form `a; b` IS JUDGED ON `b` ALONE. `a`'s exit code is
# discarded, so a command that fails outright can still leave the line green.
#   Proven false green:
#     out=$(python3 tools/validate-workflow.py BROKEN.bpmn 2>&1); echo "$out" | grep -q "VALID"
#   -> PASSES on a document the validator exits 2 on and labels INVALID, because
#      `grep -q "VALID"` matches INVALID as a SUBSTRING. Two defects stacked.
# PREFER a single command whose own exit code is the verdict — then no context question
# arises. When you must chain, the LAST command has to be the one that can fail, and its
# pattern must not be matchable by the earlier command's FAILURE output.
# Note `set -e` re-issued inside the subshell does NOT fix this: the suppressed context is
# inherited and re-setting the option does not clear it. See T-352 for the remedy.
#
# Pipefail/SIGPIPE hint (L-387): `cmd | grep -q PATTERN` exits 141 (SIGPIPE) when grep
# matches and closes stdin while the upstream is still writing — verification then
# "fails" even though the pattern was present. The capture pattern below fixes THAT,
# and creates the errexit exposure described above; the file form fixes both:
#     cmd > /tmp/.out 2>&1 && grep -q "PATTERN" /tmp/.out     # PREFERRED: && not ;
#     out=$(cmd 2>&1); echo "$out" | grep -q "PATTERN"        # SIGPIPE-safe, errexit-blind
# Origin: L-387, captured 4× (T-1716, T-1838, T-1862, T-1863) before this hint.
#
# Single pipe only — no intermediate tail/awk/sed stages between capture and grep
# (T-2090): `echo "$out" | tail -3 | grep -q PAT` re-introduces the SIGPIPE risk
# the capture step closed off — the middle stage is what `grep -q` slams its
# stdin on. `echo "$out"` is small and immediate; grep scans the whole captured
# string anyway, so the tail-3 was cosmetic. Drop it: `echo "$out" | grep -q PAT`.
#
# Enforcement-baseline hint (L-398, T-1886): if you edited `.claude/settings.json`
# (added/removed/reorganised hooks), add `bin/fw enforcement baseline` to your
# Verification block. Otherwise the canonical hash diverges and `fw doctor`
# reports a FAIL ("Enforcement baseline CHANGED") that accumulates silently.
# Origin: T-1849/T-1730/T-1731 each added a legitimate hook without refreshing
# the baseline — FAIL sat for multiple sessions until T-1886 cleaned up.

## RCA

<!-- REQUIRED for bug-class tasks (workflow_type=build with bug-tag, OR title matches
     fix/bug/rca/broken/crash/error/regression/fail/hotfix).
     Non-bug-class tasks may leave this section empty or remove it.

     For bug-class, fill in:
       **Symptom:** what was observed (the user-facing manifestation).
       **Root cause:** the specific structural/logical gap — not "the code was wrong".
       **Why structurally allowed:** what in the framework/code/tooling let this go undetected.
       **Prevention:** what catches the next instance (test/lint/gate/doc/learning) — distinct from the fix itself.

     The completion gate (T-1550, G-019) blocks --status work-completed when
     bug-class AND this section is empty/template-only. Use --skip-rca to bypass (logged).
-->

## Evolution

<!-- REQUIRED for arc-tagged build tasks (tags include arc:*). Captures how
     understanding evolved during build — what was learned that wasn't known at
     filing, what in the original plan no longer fits, what triggered pivots
     or new sub-tasks. Mandatory at slice boundaries (when applicable) and
     before --status work-completed.

     Origin: T-1717 grill Q4 — "the understanding of what we need and want
     evolves with the process of materialisation." Structural counter to §ACD:
     spec-vs-build divergence is logged as soon as it happens, not lost as
     folklore.

     Format (one entry per slice boundary or significant insight):
       ### YYYY-MM-DD — [topic]
       - **What changed:** [what we learned that we didn't know at filing]
       - **Plan impact:** [what in the plan no longer fits]
       - **Triggered:** [new sub-task / pivot / scope cut, with task ID if filed]

     The completion gate (T-1718) blocks --status work-completed when this
     section exists but is empty/template-only. Use --skip-evolution to bypass
     (logged Tier-2). Non-arc tasks may leave this empty.

## Decisions

<!-- Record decisions ONLY when choosing between alternatives.
     Skip for tasks with no meaningful choices.
     Format:
     ### [date] — [topic]
     - **Chose:** [what was decided]
     - **Why:** [rationale]
     - **Rejected:** [alternatives and why not]

## Decision

<!-- Filled at completion of inception tasks via:
     fw inception decide T-XXX go|no-go|defer --rationale "..."

     For non-inception tasks this section is ignored. Kept in template
     so `fw inception decide` (lib/inception.sh) finds the anchor heading
     without auto-creating; T-1832 added auto-create as fallback for
     legacy tasks lacking this section. -->
