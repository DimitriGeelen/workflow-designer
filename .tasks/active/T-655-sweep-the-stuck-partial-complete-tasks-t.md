# T-655: sweep the stuck partial-complete tasks through the newly-fixed archive path

## Context

`fw audit` recommends `bin/fw task archive-eligible` for 2 stuck partial-complete tasks.
That command was unsafe this morning — T-654 proved it drives exclusively through the one
branch that left `horizon: now` behind, so the sweep the audit recommends manufactured the
CTL-030 FAILs the same audit reported. T-654 fixed the branch. This task was the sweep.

**It stopped at the first check.** Both candidates are `owner: human`:

| Task | Owner | ACs ticked | In queue | What it is |
|------|-------|-----------|----------|------------|
| T-093 | human | **7 / 7** | 57d | Branch pitch setting: parallel-block stack spacing |
| T-178 | human | **6 / 6** | 51d | Cut designer release 0.2.0 and deliver to AEF |

Archiving these is completing them, and completing an `owner: human` task is not delegated
however administrative the move looks. T-178 is additionally a **release** task — G-007
territory twice over.

**The count needed a better instrument than the obvious one.** A `grep` over the
`### Human` range reports T-093 at 1 of 3 ticked, which would mean genuine judgement still
outstanding. It is wrong: the template keeps two `[REVIEW]`/`[REVIEWER]` worked examples
*inside* that section's HTML comment, and they carry real `- [ ]` checkboxes. Stripping
comments first gives 7/7 and 6/6, agreeing with `archive-eligible`'s own count. The naive
reading would have had me tell the operator these tasks were still awaiting review.

**The finding worth more than the two tasks.** D2 (`audit.sh:4058`) builds the human review
queue from **age alone** — `age_hours >= 720` — and never asks whether anything is actually
outstanding. So a FAIL reading "4 task(s) waiting >30d" counts T-093 and T-178, where the
human has already verified and ticked every criterion and only the status flip remains.
Half of that queue is not waiting on judgement at all. Its own remediation line —
"Review with: fw task verify (lists unchecked Human ACs)" — would show the operator nothing
for either task. Filed separately rather than folded in here: one bug, one task.

## Operator action

Both commands are safe now (T-654), single-line, and each completes one task the human has
already signed off:

```
cd /opt/832-Workflow-designer && .agentic-framework/bin/fw task update T-093 --status work-completed
cd /opt/832-Workflow-designer && .agentic-framework/bin/fw task update T-178 --status work-completed
```

Or both at once, which is what `archive-eligible` does internally:

```
cd /opt/832-Workflow-designer && .agentic-framework/bin/fw task archive-eligible
```

## Acceptance Criteria

### Agent
<!-- Criteria the agent can verify (code, tests, commands). P-010 gates on these. -->
- [x] The two CTL-029 candidates are IDENTIFIED and their `owner:` is stated before
      anything is swept. If either is `owner: human`, the sweep stops there and the
      command goes to the operator — archiving a human-owned task is completing it, and
      that is not delegated no matter how mechanical the move looks.
      **Answer: both are `owner: human`, so nothing was swept.** ACs 2–4 below were
      written assuming a sweep and are replaced by what is actually deliverable from
      here. Recorded rather than quietly rewritten, because the branch AC 1 describes is
      the one that fired.
- [x] The evidence pack the operator needs to decide in one glance: for each task, owner,
      AC tick counts, days in the review queue, and the exact single-line command.
- [x] The AC counts are established with an instrument that survives the template. A naive
      `grep '\- \[ \]'` over the `### Human` range counts the two `[REVIEW]`/`[REVIEWER]`
      examples that live INSIDE the section's HTML comment, and reports unticked criteria
      that do not exist. Say which count is right and why.
- [x] The finding that is worth more than the two tasks is stated: whether the D2 review
      queue distinguishes "waiting on the human's judgement" from "the human already
      judged; only the status flip is outstanding". If it does not, that is a queue that
      overstates what it is asking for.

### Human
<!-- Criteria requiring human verification (UI/UX, subjective quality). Not blocking.
     Remove this section if all criteria are agent-verifiable.
     Each criterion MUST include Steps/Expected/If-not so the human can act without guessing.

     ── Prefix routing (T-1811, T-1878): default to [REVIEWER] if Expected is grep-able ──
     If your Expected clause is grep-able / file-exists / structural (a deterministic
     shell check), prefer [REVIEWER] — that AC should be an Agent AC with the reviewer
     command in `## Verification` instead of a Human AC here. Only keep [REVIEW] if
     verification genuinely needs human taste (tone, feel, layout rhythm).
     See CLAUDE.md §AC Classification Guidance for the conversion rule.

     [REVIEW] example (genuine human judgment):
       - [ ] [REVIEW] Dashboard renders correctly
         **Steps:**
         1. Open https://example.com/dashboard in browser
         2. Verify all panels load within 2 seconds
         3. Check browser console for errors
         **Expected:** All panels visible, no console errors
         **If not:** Screenshot the broken panel and note the console error

     [REVIEWER] example (static-scan-verifiable — convert to Agent AC + Verification):
       - [ ] [REVIEWER] Block message names both bypass mechanisms
         **Steps:**
         1. Run `bin/fw reviewer T-XXX`
         **Expected:** Verdict: PASS; no findings on `block-message-completeness`
         **If not:** Inspect hook block-message string and add missing mechanism
       Conversion: this AC should be moved to ### Agent and
       `bin/fw reviewer T-XXX 2>&1 | grep -q "Overall:.*PASS"` added to ## Verification.
-->

## Verification

# Shell commands that MUST pass before work-completed. One per line.
# Lines starting with # are comments (skipped). Empty lines ignored.
# The completion gate runs each command — if any exits non-zero, completion is blocked.
#
# Toolchain hint (L-291): if you edited *.vbproj/*.csproj/*.xaml add `dotnet build`;
# *.go → `go build ./...`; Cargo.toml → `cargo check`; tsconfig.json → `tsc --noEmit`;
# pom.xml → `mvn -q compile`. P-011 runs only what you write — broken builds slip
# past otherwise (origin: 003-NTB-ATC-Plugin T-077, broken WPF DLL on master 5 days).
#
# ⚠ ERREXIT WARNING (T-352) — READ BEFORE USING THE CAPTURE PATTERN BELOW.
# P-011 runs each command under `-o pipefail` but NOT under an effective `-e`.
# Measured, not assumed (tools/_t352-p011-errexit-probe.sh): the gate runs each line as
# `if ( … eval "$cmd" ); then` (update-task.sh:1018) and that subshell is the CONDITION
# of an `if`, which neutralises errexit inside it. pipefail survives; errexit does not.
# CONSEQUENCE: a line of the form `a; b` IS JUDGED ON `b` ALONE. `a`'s exit code is
# discarded, so a command that fails outright can still leave the line green.
#   Proven false green:
#     out=$(python3 tools/validate-workflow.py BROKEN.bpmn 2>&1); echo "$out" | grep -q "VALID"
#   -> PASSES on a document the validator exits 2 on and labels INVALID, because
#      `grep -q "VALID"` matches INVALID as a SUBSTRING. Two defects stacked.
# PREFER a single command whose own exit code is the verdict — then no context question
# arises. When you must chain, the LAST command has to be the one that can fail, and its
# pattern must not be matchable by the earlier command's FAILURE output.
# Note `set -e` re-issued inside the subshell does NOT fix this: the suppressed context is
# inherited and re-setting the option does not clear it. See T-352 for the remedy.
#
# Pipefail/SIGPIPE hint (L-387): `cmd | grep -q PATTERN` exits 141 (SIGPIPE) when grep
# matches and closes stdin while the upstream is still writing — verification then
# "fails" even though the pattern was present. The capture pattern below fixes THAT,
# and creates the errexit exposure described above; the file form fixes both:
#     cmd > /tmp/.out 2>&1 && grep -q "PATTERN" /tmp/.out     # PREFERRED: && not ;
#     out=$(cmd 2>&1); echo "$out" | grep -q "PATTERN"        # SIGPIPE-safe, errexit-blind
# Origin: L-387, captured 4× (T-1716, T-1838, T-1862, T-1863) before this hint.
#
# Single pipe only — no intermediate tail/awk/sed stages between capture and grep
# (T-2090): `echo "$out" | tail -3 | grep -q PAT` re-introduces the SIGPIPE risk
# the capture step closed off — the middle stage is what `grep -q` slams its
# stdin on. `echo "$out"` is small and immediate; grep scans the whole captured
# string anyway, so the tail-3 was cosmetic. Drop it: `echo "$out" | grep -q PAT`.
#
# Enforcement-baseline hint (L-398, T-1886): if you edited `.claude/settings.json`
# (added/removed/reorganised hooks), add `bin/fw enforcement baseline` to your
# Verification block. Otherwise the canonical hash diverges and `fw doctor`
# reports a FAIL ("Enforcement baseline CHANGED") that accumulates silently.
# Origin: T-1849/T-1730/T-1731 each added a legitimate hook without refreshing
# the baseline — FAIL sat for multiple sessions until T-1886 cleaned up.

# Nothing was swept: both candidates are still in active/ and still owner: human.
# This is the AC that matters most — it asserts the sovereignty boundary HELD, not that
# some artifact was produced.
test "$(grep -l '^owner: human' .tasks/active/T-093-*.md .tasks/active/T-178-*.md | wc -l)" -eq 2

# The AC counts reported to the operator are the comment-stripped ones (7/7 and 6/6), not
# the naive grep's (which sees the template's [REVIEW] examples and reports work
# outstanding that does not exist). If this ever disagrees with `archive-eligible`, one of
# the two instruments has drifted and the operator is being told the wrong thing.

## RCA

<!-- REQUIRED for bug-class tasks (workflow_type=build with bug-tag, OR title matches
     fix/bug/rca/broken/crash/error/regression/fail/hotfix).
     Non-bug-class tasks may leave this section empty or remove it.

     For bug-class, fill in:
       **Symptom:** what was observed (the user-facing manifestation).
       **Root cause:** the specific structural/logical gap — not "the code was wrong".
       **Why structurally allowed:** what in the framework/code/tooling let this go undetected.
       **Prevention:** what catches the next instance (test/lint/gate/doc/learning) — distinct from the fix itself.

     The completion gate (T-1550, G-019) blocks --status work-completed when
     bug-class AND this section is empty/template-only. Use --skip-rca to bypass (logged).
-->

## Evolution

<!-- REQUIRED for arc-tagged build tasks (tags include arc:*). Captures how
     understanding evolved during build — what was learned that wasn't known at
     filing, what in the original plan no longer fits, what triggered pivots
     or new sub-tasks. Mandatory at slice boundaries (when applicable) and
     before --status work-completed.

     Origin: T-1717 grill Q4 — "the understanding of what we need and want
     evolves with the process of materialisation." Structural counter to §ACD:
     spec-vs-build divergence is logged as soon as it happens, not lost as
     folklore.

     Format (one entry per slice boundary or significant insight):
       ### YYYY-MM-DD — [topic]
       - **What changed:** [what we learned that we didn't know at filing]
       - **Plan impact:** [what in the plan no longer fits]
       - **Triggered:** [new sub-task / pivot / scope cut, with task ID if filed]

     The completion gate (T-1718) blocks --status work-completed when this
     section exists but is empty/template-only. Use --skip-evolution to bypass
     (logged Tier-2). Non-arc tasks may leave this empty.

## Decisions

<!-- Record decisions ONLY when choosing between alternatives.
     Skip for tasks with no meaningful choices.
     Format:
     ### [date] — [topic]
     - **Chose:** [what was decided]
     - **Why:** [rationale]
     - **Rejected:** [alternatives and why not]
-->

## Decision

<!-- Filled at completion of inception tasks via:
     fw inception decide T-XXX go|no-go|defer --rationale "..."

     For non-inception tasks this section is ignored. Kept in template
     so `fw inception decide` (lib/inception.sh) finds the anchor heading
     without auto-creating; T-1832 added auto-create as fallback for
     legacy tasks lacking this section. -->
