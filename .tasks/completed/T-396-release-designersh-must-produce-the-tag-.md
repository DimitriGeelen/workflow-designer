description: >
  T-395 prevention. The release script builds the artifact and writes MANIFEST but
  never tags; all ten prior tags were applied by hand and 0.9.0 was the first cut
  where nobody remembered. Detection already works (T-382 lag check caught it in one
  session, reporting UNMEASURED rather than defaulting to zero) so the gap is generation,
  not noticing. Make the script either create the annotated tag itself at the VERSION-bump
  commit, or refuse to print a success verdict while the tag for the version it just
  built is absent. Must assert the tagged tree carries the matching VERSION and artifact
  sha, not merely that some tag exists.

# T-396: release-designer.sh must produce the tag or refuse to report success

## Context

T-395 prevention. A cut produces **three** outputs — the artifact, the rail
announcement, and the tag — and `release-designer.sh` reported only the first two.
0.9.0 was cut, verified, announced and pushed with no tag; all ten prior tags were
applied by hand by a session that happened to remember.

**This became load-bearing on 2026-08-08.** Until now a missing tag was hygiene.
At rail 483 AEF were given a fetch path that resolves the artifact **by tag**
(`git clone --depth 1 --branch designer-v0.9.0 <public mirror>`, verified
end-to-end, anonymous). A future cut that misses its tag now breaks a live
consumer path, not just an audit line.

**Why the script cannot simply tag.** When it runs, the release commit does not
exist: `dist/` and `MANIFEST` have just been written to the *working tree* and the
commit containing them comes afterwards. `git tag` at that point names the
PREVIOUS commit — the same error T-395 nearly made by trusting MANIFEST's
`src_commit`. A tag resolving to a tree without its own VERSION and artifact is
worse than no tag, because it looks correct.

**Why it must not exit non-zero.** On a genuine fresh cut the tag *cannot* exist
yet, so failing would make every correct release "fail". A warning that fires
every time is one the reader learns to dismiss — after which an untagged release
is once again indistinguishable from a tagged one. Same fail-closed-decays-into-
fail-open argument settled on the rail for currency checks. So: exit 0, report the
true state, name the exact command.

## Acceptance Criteria

### Agent
- [x] `release-designer.sh` reports tag state as a third release output, in BOTH
      directions — a message that only ever says "NOT YET TAGGED" would pass a
      one-sided test while being useless
- [x] Tag present → final line ends `— TAGGED`, and no false NOT-TAGGED warning fires
- [x] Tag absent → final line ends `— NOT YET TAGGED`, plus a loud warning that
      names the missing tag, states the tag must follow the release commit, and
      gives a single copy-pasteable remedy including `cd`, `git tag -a` and
      `git push origin` (CLAUDE.md §T-609)
- [x] Backward compatible: the substrings `CUT and ANNOUNCED` and `CUT but NOT
      ANNOUNCED` survive verbatim in the script source — T-389's verification
      greps them and must keep matching
- [x] T-387 idempotence preserved: re-running at an unchanged VERSION leaves
      `dist/` byte-unchanged
- [x] Probe drives both branches in throwaway clones — the live `dist/`, the live
      `VERSION` and the rail are never touched (`RELEASE_SKIP_ANNOUNCE=1`)
- [x] Probe carries an anti-vacuity control: if the tag for the current VERSION is
      absent from the source repo, the TAGGED branch has no fixture and the probe
      reports CANNOT MEASURE (exit 3) rather than a result

`tools/_t396-release-tag-state.sh` — 9/9, exit 0.

### Human
<!-- Criteria requiring human verification (UI/UX, subjective quality). Not blocking.
     Remove this section if all criteria are agent-verifiable.
     Each criterion MUST include Steps/Expected/If-not so the human can act without guessing.

     ── Prefix routing (T-1811, T-1878): default to [REVIEWER] if Expected is grep-able ──
     If your Expected clause is grep-able / file-exists / structural (a deterministic
     shell check), prefer [REVIEWER] — that AC should be an Agent AC with the reviewer
     command in `## Verification` instead of a Human AC here. Only keep [REVIEW] if
     verification genuinely needs human taste (tone, feel, layout rhythm).
     See CLAUDE.md §AC Classification Guidance for the conversion rule.

     [REVIEW] example (genuine human judgment):
       - [ ] [REVIEW] Dashboard renders correctly
         **Steps:**
         1. Open https://example.com/dashboard in browser
         2. Verify all panels load within 2 seconds
         3. Check browser console for errors
         **Expected:** All panels visible, no console errors
         **If not:** Screenshot the broken panel and note the console error

     [REVIEWER] example (static-scan-verifiable — convert to Agent AC + Verification):
       - [ ] [REVIEWER] Block message names both bypass mechanisms
         **Steps:**
         1. Run `bin/fw reviewer T-XXX`
         **Expected:** Verdict: PASS; no findings on `block-message-completeness`
         **If not:** Inspect hook block-message string and add missing mechanism
       Conversion: this AC should be moved to ### Agent and
       `bin/fw reviewer T-XXX 2>&1 | grep -q "Overall:.*PASS"` added to ## Verification.

## Verification

# Shell commands that MUST pass before work-completed. One per line.
# Lines starting with # are comments (skipped). Empty lines ignored.
# The completion gate runs each command — if any exits non-zero, completion is blocked.
#
# Toolchain hint (L-291): if you edited *.vbproj/*.csproj/*.xaml add `dotnet build`;
# *.go → `go build ./...`; Cargo.toml → `cargo check`; tsconfig.json → `tsc --noEmit`;
# pom.xml → `mvn -q compile`. P-011 runs only what you write — broken builds slip
# past otherwise (origin: 003-NTB-ATC-Plugin T-077, broken WPF DLL on master 5 days).
#
# ⚠ ERREXIT WARNING (T-352) — READ BEFORE USING THE CAPTURE PATTERN BELOW.
# P-011 runs each command under `-o pipefail` but NOT under an effective `-e`.
# Measured, not assumed (tools/_t352-p011-errexit-probe.sh): the gate runs each line as
# `if ( … eval "$cmd" ); then` (update-task.sh:1018) and that subshell is the CONDITION
# of an `if`, which neutralises errexit inside it. pipefail survives; errexit does not.
# CONSEQUENCE: a line of the form `a; b` IS JUDGED ON `b` ALONE. `a`'s exit code is
# discarded, so a command that fails outright can still leave the line green.
#   Proven false green:
#     out=$(python3 tools/validate-workflow.py BROKEN.bpmn 2>&1); echo "$out" | grep -q "VALID"
#   -> PASSES on a document the validator exits 2 on and labels INVALID, because
#      `grep -q "VALID"` matches INVALID as a SUBSTRING. Two defects stacked.
# PREFER a single command whose own exit code is the verdict — then no context question
# arises. When you must chain, the LAST command has to be the one that can fail, and its
# pattern must not be matchable by the earlier command's FAILURE output.
# Note `set -e` re-issued inside the subshell does NOT fix this: the suppressed context is
# inherited and re-setting the option does not clear it. See T-352 for the remedy.
#
# Pipefail/SIGPIPE hint (L-387): `cmd | grep -q PATTERN` exits 141 (SIGPIPE) when grep
# matches and closes stdin while the upstream is still writing — verification then
# "fails" even though the pattern was present. The capture pattern below fixes THAT,
# and creates the errexit exposure described above; the file form fixes both:
#     cmd > /tmp/.out 2>&1 && grep -q "PATTERN" /tmp/.out     # PREFERRED: && not ;
#     out=$(cmd 2>&1); echo "$out" | grep -q "PATTERN"        # SIGPIPE-safe, errexit-blind
# Origin: L-387, captured 4× (T-1716, T-1838, T-1862, T-1863) before this hint.
#
# Single pipe only — no intermediate tail/awk/sed stages between capture and grep
# (T-2090): `echo "$out" | tail -3 | grep -q PAT` re-introduces the SIGPIPE risk
# the capture step closed off — the middle stage is what `grep -q` slams its
# stdin on. `echo "$out"` is small and immediate; grep scans the whole captured
# string anyway, so the tail-3 was cosmetic. Drop it: `echo "$out" | grep -q PAT`.
#
# Enforcement-baseline hint (L-398, T-1886): if you edited `.claude/settings.json`
# (added/removed/reorganised hooks), add `bin/fw enforcement baseline` to your
# Verification block. Otherwise the canonical hash diverges and `fw doctor`
# reports a FAIL ("Enforcement baseline CHANGED") that accumulates silently.
# Origin: T-1849/T-1730/T-1731 each added a legitimate hook without refreshing
# the baseline — FAIL sat for multiple sessions until T-1886 cleaned up.

# Both branches (tag present / tag absent) in throwaway clones. Single command
# whose own exit code is the verdict, so the T-352 errexit trap does not arise.
# Exits 3 (not 1) if it could not measure — a missing fixture is not a pass.
bash tools/_t396-release-tag-state.sh
# Backward compatibility, asserted independently of the probe so a probe defect
# cannot hide a regression that would break T-389's verification.
grep -q "CUT but NOT ANNOUNCED" scripts/release-designer.sh
grep -q "CUT and ANNOUNCED" scripts/release-designer.sh
# The live release is still tagged and still measurable (T-395 must not regress).
python3 tools/_t382-release-lag.py > /tmp/.t396-lag 2>&1 && ! grep -q "COULD NOT MEASURE" /tmp/.t396-lag

## RCA

<!-- REQUIRED for bug-class tasks (workflow_type=build with bug-tag, OR title matches
     fix/bug/rca/broken/crash/error/regression/fail/hotfix).
     Non-bug-class tasks may leave this section empty or remove it.

     For bug-class, fill in:
       **Symptom:** what was observed (the user-facing manifestation).
       **Root cause:** the specific structural/logical gap — not "the code was wrong".
       **Why structurally allowed:** what in the framework/code/tooling let this go undetected.
       **Prevention:** what catches the next instance (test/lint/gate/doc/learning) — distinct from the fix itself.

     The completion gate (T-1550, G-019) blocks --status work-completed when
     bug-class AND this section is empty/template-only. Use --skip-rca to bypass (logged).
-->

## Evolution

<!-- REQUIRED for arc-tagged build tasks (tags include arc:*). Captures how
     understanding evolved during build — what was learned that wasn't known at
     filing, what in the original plan no longer fits, what triggered pivots
     or new sub-tasks. Mandatory at slice boundaries (when applicable) and
     before --status work-completed.

     Origin: T-1717 grill Q4 — "the understanding of what we need and want
     evolves with the process of materialisation." Structural counter to §ACD:
     spec-vs-build divergence is logged as soon as it happens, not lost as
     folklore.

     Format (one entry per slice boundary or significant insight):
       ### YYYY-MM-DD — [topic]
       - **What changed:** [what we learned that we didn't know at filing]
       - **Plan impact:** [what in the plan no longer fits]
       - **Triggered:** [new sub-task / pivot / scope cut, with task ID if filed]

     The completion gate (T-1718) blocks --status work-completed when this
     section exists but is empty/template-only. Use --skip-evolution to bypass
     (logged Tier-2). Non-arc tasks may leave this empty.
-->

## Decisions

<!-- Record decisions ONLY when choosing between alternatives.
     Skip for tasks with no meaningful choices.
     Format:
     ### [date] — [topic]
     - **Chose:** [what was decided]
     - **Why:** [rationale]
     - **Rejected:** [alternatives and why not]
-->

## Decision

<!-- Filled at completion of inception tasks via:
     fw inception decide T-XXX go|no-go|defer --rationale "..."

     For non-inception tasks this section is ignored. Kept in template
     so `fw inception decide` (lib/inception.sh) finds the anchor heading
     without auto-creating; T-1832 added auto-create as fallback for
     legacy tasks lacking this section. -->
