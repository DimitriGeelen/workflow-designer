description: >
  Found 2026-11-11: job 130 (close T-358) stopped at preflight because the operator's
  user could not read .tasks/active/T-358-*.md (root, mode 600; ACL user:dimitri-mint-dev:rwx
  but mask ---). 91 active task files and 659 files under .tasks/.context are mode
  600. Restore 664 on .tasks/*.md (not .context, which holds secrets that must stay
  600) and find the writer that creates them 600.

# T-1393: Task files lose the operator's access: something rewrites .tasks/*.md with mode 600, which zeroes the ACL mask, so operator jobs (run as dimitri-mint-dev) cannot read them

## Context

<!-- All four parts are required before source edits (T-4907). Plain language; link design docs for substantial tasks. -->
**Background / trigger:** 2026-11-11, job 130 (close T-358) stopped at preflight: "both of T-358's review criteria are
ticked" failed under the operator's user although the file had both ticks. The job log is owned by dimitri-mint-dev:
operator jobs run as that user, not root.

**Problem / hypothesis:** `.tasks/active/T-358-*.md` is root, mode 600, with ACL `user:dimitri-mint-dev:rwx` but mask
`---` (a chmod to 600 sets the mask from the group bits), so the operator's access is cancelled. 91 active task files are
600; 129 are 664 as intended. Hypothesis: a tool rewrites task files atomically through a temp file created 600
(mkstemp) and renames it over the original, losing the mode.

**Goal:** give the operator back access to every task file now, and find and fix the writer that makes them 600.
(2026-11-11: 634 task files reset from 600 to 664.)

**Expected outcome:** no `.tasks/**/*.md` file is mode 600; the writer keeps the original mode; job 130 runs.

## Acceptance Criteria

### Agent
<!-- Criteria the agent can verify (code, tests, commands). P-010 gates on these. -->
- [x] Every `.tasks/**/*.md` file that was mode 600 is 664 again, and its ACL's effective entry for dimitri-mint-dev is
  rw; `.context` is left alone (it holds secrets that must stay 600).
  *(2026-11-11: 634 files reset; none left at 600; T-358's ACL effective rw-. The folders the close writes
  (.tasks/active, .tasks/completed, .context/episodic) are 775 with the operator's rwx effective.)*
- [x] The writer that produces mode-600 task files is found (reproduced) and fixed, or reported to AEF if it is the
  vendored framework's.
  *(Reproduced: `fw task update T-1393 --add-tag perms` turned the file 664 → 600; the Edit tool keeps 664. Cause: the
  vendored framework's `_sed_i` (`lib/compat.sh`, fallback in `lib/paths.sh`) writes via `mktemp` (0600) and `mv`s it over
  the file; mktemp's 0600 zeroes the ACL mask. `lib/task_updates.py` already keeps the mode. Reported to AEF with a
  portable fix, msg 01a69304, conversation fw-sed-i-mode-600. AEF confirmed and reproduced it: **AEF T-5077**
  (msg 1e055cb4), fix = write back through the original inode, with a mode + ACL regression test; they will name the
  be-tag. 2026-11-11 (msg 31304b50): fixed on AEF bleeding-edge, commit 0c42d3ddf — keeps the atomic temp + mv and
  copies mode, owner (as root) and ACL onto the temp file first; tested 0664 stays 0664 and a named-user ACL entry stays
  effective. No be-tag yet. Remaining here: repin to that be-tag, then check `fw task update` keeps a 0664 task file
  0664 (then close). Until it ships, any `fw task update` can make one file 600
  again: before handing over an operator job that reads a task file, check its mode.)*
  *(2026-11-13, close: vendored since be.47 (dfe00676a, 2026-11-12) and be.48; both `_sed_i` copies (lib/compat.sh,
  the lib/paths.sh fallback) keep the mode. `fw task update T-1393 --add-tag` kept this file 664; the post-commit
  last_update bump kept T-1409 and T-1410 at 664. One leftover was found: T-1297 at 600, made so by six T-1297 commits
  on 2026-11-11 evening under the pre-fix code and kept 600 since, because the fix preserves the existing mode. Reset
  to 664 (dimitri-mint-dev effective rw-); 0 of 1,409 task files are now anything but 664.)*

### Human
<!-- Criteria requiring human verification (UI/UX, subjective quality). Not blocking.
     Remove this section if all criteria are agent-verifiable.
     Each criterion MUST include Steps/Expected/If-not so the human can act without guessing.

     ── Prefix routing (T-1811, T-1878): default to [REVIEWER] if Expected is grep-able ──
     If your Expected clause is grep-able / file-exists / structural (a deterministic
     shell check), prefer [REVIEWER] — that AC should be an Agent AC with the reviewer
     command in `## Verification` instead of a Human AC here. Only keep [REVIEW] if
     verification genuinely needs human taste (tone, feel, layout rhythm).
     See CLAUDE.md §AC Classification Guidance for the conversion rule.

     [REVIEW] example (genuine human judgment):
       - [ ] [REVIEW] Dashboard renders correctly
         **Steps:**
         1. Open https://example.com/dashboard in browser
         2. Verify all panels load within 2 seconds
         3. Check browser console for errors
         **Expected:** All panels visible, no console errors
         **If not:** Screenshot the broken panel and note the console error

     [REVIEWER] example (static-scan-verifiable — convert to Agent AC + Verification):
       - [ ] [REVIEWER] Block message names both bypass mechanisms
         **Steps:**
         1. Run `bin/fw reviewer T-1393`
         **Expected:** Verdict: PASS; no findings on `block-message-completeness`
         **If not:** Inspect hook block-message string and add missing mechanism
       Conversion: this AC should be moved to ### Agent and
       `bin/fw reviewer T-1393 2>&1 | grep -q "Overall:.*PASS"` added to ## Verification.

<!--
  Render-touching build tasks (web/templates, web/static, web/blueprints, web/shared.py,
  web/app.py …) add a section headed "Visual Verification" (level-2 heading) after
  Verification, with one checklist table — the check-visual-verification gate reads it
  at commit time (T-4213; T-4202 GO):

    | state | control | 1024 | 1440 | 1920 | note |
    |-------|---------|------|------|------|------|
    | toolbar | Load | ok | ok | ok | |

  Cells: ok / clipped / hidden / overlap / unreachable (non-ok needs a note). Each
  listed state needs screenshots at every UX_SHOT_WIDTHS width:
  fw ux shots <T-ID> <state>=<URL>. This comment is inert: the gate ignores it.
-->

#
# ── Mutable-corpus anchor (T-3326) ────────────────────────────────────────────
# Do NOT anchor a verification line (or a unit test it runs) to MUTABLE corpus
# state — an exact live count, or a grep of live `fw audit`/`fw doctor` output
# for a specific corpus entity (a named arc, a task count, a census number).
# The corpus moves under the check, and the line rots: it goes red (or vanishes
# its pattern) for reasons unrelated to the code under test, blocking closes.
# Pin the INVARIANT (categories sum, count > 0, property holds) or run the code
# against a COMMITTED FIXTURE — never the live count or a live-audit line.
# Origin: T-2969 line grepping live audit for one arc's status; T-2871's census
# test pinning exact live counts (56→74 files) — both blocked closes (OBS-377).
#
# ── Pipefail/SIGPIPE: grepping a command's output (L-387, T-2090, T-2743, T-2738) ──
#
# THE DEFAULT — redirect to a file, then grep the file:
#     cmd > /tmp/.out 2>&1 && grep -q "PATTERN" /tmp/.out
#     curl -sf "$(bin/fw watchtower url)/page" -o /tmp/.out && grep -q "PAT" /tmp/.out
# Correct at any output size, and `&&` keeps the PRODUCING command's exit code in
# the verdict. Reach for this first; the alternative below is the special case.
#
# Why not `cmd | grep -q PAT` (L-387): P-011 runs each line with PIPEFAIL LIVE
# (errexit is not — see below). When grep matches it exits and closes stdin while cmd is still
# writing, cmd takes SIGPIPE, the pipeline exits 141 — verification "fails" with
# the pattern present. Captured 4× (T-1716, T-1838, T-1862, T-1863).
#
# THE EXCEPTION — capture first, grep the capture with a HERE-STRING:
#     out=$(cmd 2>&1); grep -q "PATTERN" <<<"$out"
# No pipe, so no SIGPIPE at any size. Do NOT write `echo "$out" | grep -q PAT`:
# it is not safe "below 64 KB" as this file used to say (T-4921, 832 T-1340). The
# builtin writes a multi-line value line by line, so grep -q can exit before the
# last write at ANY size (measured 4 in 3,000 for a 40-line value), and above the
# pipe buffer it fails every time (T-2743: 146,366-byte page, 3/3). In a gate that
# allows on "no match" that is a fail-OPEN (T-4920: the Tier 0 pre-filter).
# The capture still discards cmd's exit code, so a 404 yields an empty capture that
# grep merely fails to match rather than a failed line — prefer THE DEFAULT above.
#
# TEST RUNNERS need a guard either way (T-2738). `set -e` is suppressed inside the
# `if` condition the gate runs each line in, so in `cmd1; cmd2` only cmd2 is the
# verdict — and the pass marker you grep for survives a partial failure: a suite
# printing "3 failed, 9 passed" satisfies `grep -q "9 passed"`, and generalising
# to `grep -qE "[0-9]+ passed"` matches the same output. Keep the exit code:
#     python3 -m pytest <file> -q > /tmp/.out 2>&1 && grep -q passed /tmp/.out
# or add the guard the exit code used to supply:
#     out=$(python3 -m pytest <file> -q 2>&1); grep -q passed <<<"$out" && ! grep -q failed <<<"$out"
#     out=$(bats <file> 2>&1); grep -q '^ok 1 ' <<<"$out" && ! grep -q '^not ok' <<<"$out"
# The close gate refuses the unguarded form. Bypass: FW_ALLOW_UNJUDGED_TEST_RUN=1.
#
# ── A SKIPPED BATS TEST REPORTS `ok` (T-3217) ─────────────────────────────────
#
# `! grep -q "^not ok"` does NOT mean the suite ran. Bats emits a skip as
#     ok 6 <name> # skip <reason>
# which is not a `not ok`, so the gate passes and the report says ok while the
# thing the test covers was measured NOWHERE. Origin: T-3213 guarded a test with
# `[ "$(id -u)" -eq 0 ] && skip` — the suite runs as root here and in CI, so it
# skipped on every run that mattered, for as long as it existed.
#
# Add a skip clause to any bats verification line. `# skip` is the marker bats
# writes; counting it is the whole check:
#     timeout 300 bats <file> > /tmp/.out 2>&1 && ! grep -q "^not ok" /tmp/.out
#     test "$(grep -c '# skip' /tmp/.out)" -eq 0
# Two lines, because they answer different questions — "did anything fail" and
# "did everything run". If some skips are legitimate on your host (an optional
# dependency is genuinely absent), assert the COUNT you expect rather than zero,
# and say in the task why that number is right.
#
# Corpus-wide, the same check runs from `bin/fw test lint`
# (tools/bats-silent-skip-lint.py): static mode flags guards that are fixed for
# a deployment rather than probing an optional dependency, and `--tap FILE`
# reports the skips a real run actually fired.
#
# REHEARSING A LINE BY HAND DOES NOT REHEARSE THE GATE (T-2743). Your interactive
# shell has no pipefail. A line has returned 0 by hand and 141 under P-011, from
# the same directory, the same second. To rehearse for real:
#     bash -c 'set -o pipefail; <your verification line>'
#
# NOTE THE MISSING `-e` — it is not a typo (T-3203). This file used to prescribe
# `set -eo pipefail` here, which is NOT the gate: it adds errexit the gate does
# not have, so it FAILS lines the gate PASSES. Measured, 10 lines, 3 diverged:
#     line                            gate    set -eo (old)   set -o (this)
#     false; true                     PASS    FAIL  wrong     PASS  ok
#     cd /nonexistent; echo ok        PASS    FAIL  wrong     PASS  ok
#     grep -q MISS file; true         PASS    FAIL  wrong     PASS  ok
# The divergence is one-directional and that is the trap: the old rehearsal only
# ever fails lines the gate accepts, so it produces false REDS, and an author
# who "fixes" a line to satisfy it is fixing something that was never broken —
# while the line that actually is broken (`cmd1; cmd2` where cmd1 fails) passes
# both. Re-derive rather than trust this table — it is pinned, not asserted:
#     bats tests/unit/t3203_p011_gate_semantics.bats
#
# ── `cmd1; cmd2` IS JUDGED ONLY ON cmd2 (T-3203) ──────────────────────────────
#
# The gate runs each line as the CONDITION of an `if` (update-task.sh:1215), and
# POSIX suppresses errexit for a compound command in an `if` condition — through
# the subshell. So pipefail applies and `set -e` does not, and in a sequence only
# the LAST command's status reaches the verdict. `cd /nonexistent; echo ok` passes.
# 2,644 of 10,997 verification lines in this corpus contain `;` (re-derive with
# the query in docs/reports/T-3203-p011-gate-semantics.md).
#
# SAFE SHAPES — both verified biting, each against a passing control:
#   A. one command whose own status is the verdict (prefer this):
#        out=$(cmd 2>&1); echo "$out" | grep -q PAT && ! echo "$out" | grep -q BAD
#      the leading assignments are setup; the trailing `&&` chain is the verdict.
#   B. an explicit sub-shell, whose errexit the outer `if` cannot reach into:
#        bash -c 'set -eo pipefail; cmd1; cmd2'
#      use when you genuinely need every command in the sequence to count.
#
# The rule of thumb: put the assertion LAST, and make sure it is an assertion.
#
# Enforcement-baseline hint (L-398, T-1886): if you edited `.claude/settings.json`
# (added/removed/reorganised hooks), add `bin/fw enforcement baseline` to your
# Verification block. Otherwise the canonical hash diverges and `fw doctor`
# reports a FAIL ("Enforcement baseline CHANGED") that accumulates silently.
# Origin: T-1849/T-1730/T-1731 each added a legitimate hook without refreshing
# the baseline — FAIL sat for multiple sessions until T-1886 cleaned up.
#
# Vendored-path hint (T-3236, T-4419): if you edited bin/fw, lib/, agents/, policy/,
# web/, tools/ or .tasks/templates/, run `bin/fw vendor self` and add
#     bin/fw vendor self --check --task T-1393X
# (your own task id). It checks only the files your commits changed, so another
# worker's uncommitted edit does not block your close; that drift is listed as
# "in flight, not this task". The whole-tree `--check` stays for audit/pre-push.

<!-- REQUIRED for arc-tagged build tasks (tags include arc:*). Captures how
     understanding evolved during build — what was learned that wasn't known at
     filing, what in the original plan no longer fits, what triggered pivots
     or new sub-tasks. Mandatory at slice boundaries (when applicable) and
     before --status work-completed.

     Origin: T-1717 grill Q4 — "the understanding of what we need and want
     evolves with the process of materialisation." Structural counter to §ACD:
     spec-vs-build divergence is logged as soon as it happens, not lost as
     folklore.

     Format (one entry per slice boundary or significant insight):
       ### YYYY-MM-DD — [topic]
       - **What changed:** [what we learned that we didn't know at filing]
       - **Plan impact:** [what in the plan no longer fits]
       - **Triggered:** [new sub-task / pivot / scope cut, with task ID if filed]

     The completion gate (T-1718) blocks --status work-completed when this
     section exists but is empty/template-only. Use --skip-evolution to bypass
     (logged Tier-2). Non-arc tasks may leave this empty.
-->

## Recommendation

<!-- T-2945: same shape as inception.md's block — the gate that reads it
     (audit_inception_recommendation, lib/task-audit.sh:117) is shared, so the
     shape is copied rather than reinvented.

     REQUIRED once this task reaches partial-complete: Agent ACs done, at least
     one `### Human` AC still unticked. `lib/review.sh:205-211` (T-2421) BLOCKS
     `fw task review` emission for build/refactor/test/decommission tasks in that
     state with no substantive block here — the operator would otherwise open
     /review/<id> to a blank Recommendation card and be asked to approve a form.

     Not required while every Human AC is ticked or the task has none: the gate
     only fires on the partial-complete transition. It is here from the start so
     you write it while you still have the evidence, not when the gate refuses.

     Format (the parser wants the `**Recommendation:**` line at the start of a
     line; a leading `-` or `*` bullet is also accepted):
     **Recommendation:** GO / NO-GO / DEFER
     **Rationale:** Why (cite evidence — what shipped, what was proven, what remains)
     **Evidence:**
     - Finding 1
     - Finding 2

     DEFER is for evidence gaps, not confidence gaps (CLAUDE.md §Presenting Work
     for Human Review). If the artefact is complete and you still don't want to
     commit, that is a calibration failure — recommend GO or NO-GO.
-->

## Decisions

<!-- Record decisions ONLY when choosing between alternatives.
     Skip for tasks with no meaningful choices.
     Format:
     ### [date] — [topic]
     - **Chose:** [what was decided]
     - **Why:** [rationale]
     - **Rejected:** [alternatives and why not]
-->

## Decision

<!-- Filled at completion of inception tasks via:
     fw inception decide T-1393 go|no-go|defer --rationale "..."

     For non-inception tasks this section is ignored. Kept in template
     so `fw inception decide` (lib/inception.sh) finds the anchor heading
     without auto-creating; T-1832 added auto-create as fallback for
     legacy tasks lacking this section. -->
