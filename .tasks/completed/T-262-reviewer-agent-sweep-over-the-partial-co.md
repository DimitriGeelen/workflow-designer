description: >
  Operator directive 2026-07-27 ('for the 3 consider using our reviewer agent'): run
  fw reviewer across the ~54 partial-complete tasks awaiting Human [REVIEW] ticks,
  collect per-task verdicts (PASS/findings), and produce a digest the operator can
  rule from — evidence per task, never ticking Human ACs (T-372/T-373: suggest-with-evidence
  only). Output: digest report in docs/reports/ + summary to operator with per-task
  citations.

# T-262: Reviewer-agent sweep over the partial-complete review queue: evidence verdicts for operator

## Context

Operator directive: use the framework reviewer agent on the review queue.
The reviewer (fw reviewer) writes structural verdicts into task bodies; this sweep
runs it across every partial-complete task and digests the results so the operator
can rule from evidence. Human ACs are NEVER ticked by this task (T-372/T-373).

## Acceptance Criteria

### Agent
- [x] `fw reviewer T-XXX` run on every partial-complete task in .tasks/active/
      (status work-completed, unchecked Human ACs); per-task verdict written to the
      task body by the reviewer itself. (57/57 swept 2026-07-27; 38 PASS / 19 CONCERN
      / 0 FAIL; verdicts in each task's `## Reviewer Verdict (v1.5)` section.)
- [x] Digest report at docs/reports/T-262-reviewer-sweep.md: per-task verdict table
      (PASS / findings count / notable finding), grouped so the operator can
      rubber-stamp the clean ones and inspect the flagged ones. (Clean-38 list +
      flagged-19 by pattern with per-pattern FP assessment.)
- [x] Summary to operator with counts + the flagged subset called out; zero Human
      AC checkboxes modified by this sweep. (Reviewer writes only its verdict
      section; sweep loop invoked `fw reviewer` exclusively — no task edits by hand.)

### Human
<!-- Criteria requiring human verification (UI/UX, subjective quality). Not blocking.
     Remove this section if all criteria are agent-verifiable.
     Each criterion MUST include Steps/Expected/If-not so the human can act without guessing.

     ── Prefix routing (T-1811, T-1878): default to [REVIEWER] if Expected is grep-able ──
     If your Expected clause is grep-able / file-exists / structural (a deterministic
     shell check), prefer [REVIEWER] — that AC should be an Agent AC with the reviewer
     command in `## Verification` instead of a Human AC here. Only keep [REVIEW] if
     verification genuinely needs human taste (tone, feel, layout rhythm).
     See CLAUDE.md §AC Classification Guidance for the conversion rule.

     [REVIEW] example (genuine human judgment):
       - [ ] [REVIEW] Dashboard renders correctly
         **Steps:**
         1. Open https://example.com/dashboard in browser
         2. Verify all panels load within 2 seconds
         3. Check browser console for errors
         **Expected:** All panels visible, no console errors
         **If not:** Screenshot the broken panel and note the console error

     [REVIEWER] example (static-scan-verifiable — convert to Agent AC + Verification):
       - [ ] [REVIEWER] Block message names both bypass mechanisms
         **Steps:**
         1. Run `bin/fw reviewer T-XXX`
         **Expected:** Verdict: PASS; no findings on `block-message-completeness`
         **If not:** Inspect hook block-message string and add missing mechanism
       Conversion: this AC should be moved to ### Agent and
       `bin/fw reviewer T-XXX 2>&1 | grep -q "Overall:.*PASS"` added to ## Verification.
-->

## Verification

# Shell commands that MUST pass before work-completed. One per line.
# Lines starting with # are comments (skipped). Empty lines ignored.
# The completion gate runs each command — if any exits non-zero, completion is blocked.
#
# Toolchain hint (L-291): if you edited *.vbproj/*.csproj/*.xaml add `dotnet build`;
# *.go → `go build ./...`; Cargo.toml → `cargo check`; tsconfig.json → `tsc --noEmit`;
# pom.xml → `mvn -q compile`. P-011 runs only what you write — broken builds slip
# past otherwise (origin: 003-NTB-ATC-Plugin T-077, broken WPF DLL on master 5 days).
#
# Pipefail/SIGPIPE hint (L-387): P-011 runs each command under `set -eo pipefail`.
# `cmd | grep -q PATTERN` exits 141 (SIGPIPE) when grep matches and closes stdin
# while the upstream is still writing — verification then "fails" even though
# the pattern was present. Safe pattern: capture first, grep the capture:
#     out=$(cmd 2>&1); echo "$out" | grep -q "PATTERN"
# Or:
#     cmd > /tmp/.out 2>&1 && grep -q "PATTERN" /tmp/.out
# Origin: L-387, captured 4× (T-1716, T-1838, T-1862, T-1863) before this hint.
#
# Single pipe only — no intermediate tail/awk/sed stages between capture and grep
# (T-2090): `echo "$out" | tail -3 | grep -q PAT` re-introduces the SIGPIPE risk
# the capture step closed off — the middle stage is what `grep -q` slams its
# stdin on. `echo "$out"` is small and immediate; grep scans the whole captured
# string anyway, so the tail-3 was cosmetic. Drop it: `echo "$out" | grep -q PAT`.
#
# Enforcement-baseline hint (L-398, T-1886): if you edited `.claude/settings.json`
# (added/removed/reorganised hooks), add `bin/fw enforcement baseline` to your
# Verification block. Otherwise the canonical hash diverges and `fw doctor`
# reports a FAIL ("Enforcement baseline CHANGED") that accumulates silently.
# Origin: T-1849/T-1730/T-1731 each added a legitimate hook without refreshing
# the baseline — FAIL sat for multiple sessions until T-1886 cleaned up.

test -f policy/anti-patterns.yaml
test -f policy/escalation-patterns.yaml
test -f docs/reports/T-262-reviewer-sweep.md
n=$(grep -l "^status: work-completed" .tasks/active/*.md | xargs grep -l "## Reviewer Verdict (v1.5)" | wc -l); [ "$n" -eq 57 ]

## RCA

<!-- REQUIRED for bug-class tasks (workflow_type=build with bug-tag, OR title matches
     fix/bug/rca/broken/crash/error/regression/fail/hotfix).
     Non-bug-class tasks may leave this section empty or remove it.

     For bug-class, fill in:
       **Symptom:** what was observed (the user-facing manifestation).
       **Root cause:** the specific structural/logical gap — not "the code was wrong".
       **Why structurally allowed:** what in the framework/code/tooling let this go undetected.
       **Prevention:** what catches the next instance (test/lint/gate/doc/learning) — distinct from the fix itself.

     The completion gate (T-1550, G-019) blocks --status work-completed when
     bug-class AND this section is empty/template-only. Use --skip-rca to bypass (logged).
-->

## Evolution

<!-- REQUIRED for arc-tagged build tasks (tags include arc:*). Captures how
     understanding evolved during build — what was learned that wasn't known at
     filing, what in the original plan no longer fits, what triggered pivots
     or new sub-tasks. Mandatory at slice boundaries (when applicable) and
     before --status work-completed.

     Origin: T-1717 grill Q4 — "the understanding of what we need and want
     evolves with the process of materialisation." Structural counter to §ACD:
     spec-vs-build divergence is logged as soon as it happens, not lost as
     folklore.

     Format (one entry per slice boundary or significant insight):
       ### YYYY-MM-DD — [topic]
       - **What changed:** [what we learned that we didn't know at filing]
       - **Plan impact:** [what in the plan no longer fits]
       - **Triggered:** [new sub-task / pivot / scope cut, with task ID if filed]

     The completion gate (T-1718) blocks --status work-completed when this
     section exists but is empty/template-only. Use --skip-evolution to bypass
     (logged Tier-2). Non-arc tasks may leave this empty.
-->

## Decisions

<!-- Record decisions ONLY when choosing between alternatives.
     Skip for tasks with no meaningful choices.
     Format:
     ### [date] — [topic]
     - **Chose:** [what was decided]
     - **Why:** [rationale]
     - **Rejected:** [alternatives and why not]
-->

## Decision

<!-- Filled at completion of inception tasks via:
     fw inception decide T-XXX go|no-go|defer --rationale "..."

     For non-inception tasks this section is ignored. Kept in template
     so `fw inception decide` (lib/inception.sh) finds the anchor heading
     without auto-creating; T-1832 added auto-create as fallback for
     legacy tasks lacking this section. -->

## Updates

### 2026-07-27T19:23:06Z — task-created [task-create-agent]
- **Action:** Created task via task-create agent
- **Output:** /opt/832-Workflow-designer/.tasks/active/T-262-reviewer-agent-sweep-over-the-partial-co.md
- **Context:** Initial task creation

### 2026-07-27T19:23:07Z — status-update [task-update-agent]
- **Change:** status: captured → started-work

### 2026-07-27T20:28:57Z — status-update [task-update-agent]
- **Change:** status: started-work → issues
- **Reason:** fw reviewer structurally unrunnable: vendored .agentic-framework/ ships reviewer code without policy/anti-patterns.yaml catalogue (no policy/ dir framework- or project-side). G-011 registered; catalogue requested from AEF at rail 229 (file_send ask). Sweep resumes on receipt.

### 2026-07-27T21:18:53Z — status-update [task-update-agent]
- **Change:** status: issues → started-work

### 2026-07-27T21:19:01Z — issue-resolved [healing-agent]
- **Action:** Issue resolved via healing loop
- **Output:** Pattern FP-008 recorded
- **Mitigation:** AEF delivered both reviewer policy files via file_send (rail 234, their T-2636): anti-patterns.yaml sha 04f89678 + escalation-patterns.yaml sha 7ebf939d; installed project-local per the code's vendored-consumer fallback path
- **Context:** Resolution logged for future reference

## Reviewer Verdict (v1.5)

- **Scan ID:** R-2692efff
- **Timestamp:** 2026-07-27T21:23:09Z
- **Catalogue:** v1.3-seed
- **Overall:** PASS
- **Needs Human:** no
- **Findings:** none

### 2026-07-27T21:23:08Z — status-update [task-update-agent]
- **Change:** status: started-work → work-completed
