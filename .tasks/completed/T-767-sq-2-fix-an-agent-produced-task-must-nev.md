# T-767: SQ-2 fix: an agent-produced task must never be born owner:human with zero Human ACs

## Context

### The ruling

**SQ-2 — Should an agent-produced task ever be born `owner: human` with zero Human
ACs? → NO.** Operator, 2026-09-21, verbatim: *"No, that's wrong per definition. Yeah,
I've seen it, so we need to fix that."*

### The defect in its own terms

A task created `owner: human` with no Human acceptance criteria is **unclearable by
the agent that created it.** Completing an `owner: human` task is not delegated, so
the agent manufactures work it is structurally forbidden to finish. The task then sits
in `started-work` with every Agent AC ticked and nothing outstanding, and lands in a
review queue that is already 67 deep — carrying nothing for the reviewer to actually
review.

The ownership field is meant to answer *"who verifies this?"*. When there are zero
Human ACs, the honest answer is "nobody has to", and `owner: human` asserts the
opposite.

### The four instances that proved it

CTL-029 reported all four as *completable, not closed*. They are arc-003's own
remediation tasks, which is what made the fault visible: the remediation arc began
generating the findings it exists to remediate, and could not clear them.

| Finding | Task | Subject |
|---|---|---|
| RA-038 | T-747 | T-702 (36 urgent observations pending) |
| RA-039 | T-748 | T-703 (107 observations pending >7d) |
| RA-040 | T-749 | T-708 (two stuck partial-complete tasks) |
| RA-041 | T-750 | T-723 (review queue >30d) |

### Scope boundary

This task fixes the **creation path** so the condition stops being produced. It does
**not** change the ownership of the four existing tasks — changing ownership away from
human is not delegated, and the operator's ruling authorises fixing the generator, not
reassigning records the rule already produced. Their disposition stays with T-747–T-750.

L-302 applies directly: fix the generator before shipping the detector, or the
detector just reports the generator's output forever.

### Root-cause links

Instances: RA-038/T-747, RA-039/T-748, RA-040/T-749, RA-041/T-750. Upstream report: T-768. Ruling: SQ-2 in `.context/project/decisions.yaml`, recorded by T-766.

## Acceptance Criteria

### Agent
<!-- Criteria the agent can verify (code, tests, commands). P-010 gates on these. -->
- [ ] The creation path that can emit `owner: human` with zero Human ACs is located and named — file and line — rather than inferred from the symptom.
- [ ] Whether the fault is in this project's usage or in the vendored framework's task-creation agent is established. If it is the vendored framework, the fix is made in-tree under G-008 and T-768 carries it upstream; the two are not conflated.
- [ ] Ownership follows the presence of real Human ACs: a task with zero Human ACs is not born `owner: human`. The rule is stated so a reader can predict the ownership of a task before creating it.
- [ ] A negative control demonstrates the fix: attempting to create a task in the old shape either produces `owner: agent` or is refused, and the check that demonstrates it is recorded. An assertion that it works without the check is an open task, not a closed one.
- [ ] The four existing instances are NOT reassigned and no `### Human` AC is ticked. This task fixes the generator only.

<!-- No Human ACs: the operator has already ruled on the question behind this
     task, and what remains is agent-verifiable. Adding an empty Human section
     would lengthen a review queue already 67 deep (SQ-3) with nothing to review.

     Original template guidance retained below for the next editor.

     Criteria requiring human verification (UI/UX, subjective quality). Not blocking.
     Remove this section if all criteria are agent-verifiable.
     Each criterion MUST include Steps/Expected/If-not so the human can act without guessing.

     ── Prefix routing (T-1811, T-1878): default to [REVIEWER] if Expected is grep-able ──
     If your Expected clause is grep-able / file-exists / structural (a deterministic
     shell check), prefer [REVIEWER] — that AC should be an Agent AC with the reviewer
     command in `## Verification` instead of a Human AC here. Only keep [REVIEW] if
     verification genuinely needs human taste (tone, feel, layout rhythm).
     See CLAUDE.md §AC Classification Guidance for the conversion rule.

     [REVIEW] example (genuine human judgment):
       - [ ] [REVIEW] Dashboard renders correctly
         **Steps:**
         1. Open https://example.com/dashboard in browser
         2. Verify all panels load within 2 seconds
         3. Check browser console for errors
         **Expected:** All panels visible, no console errors
         **If not:** Screenshot the broken panel and note the console error

     [REVIEWER] example (static-scan-verifiable — convert to Agent AC + Verification):
       - [ ] [REVIEWER] Block message names both bypass mechanisms
         **Steps:**
         1. Run `bin/fw reviewer T-767`
         **Expected:** Verdict: PASS; no findings on `block-message-completeness`
         **If not:** Inspect hook block-message string and add missing mechanism
       Conversion: this AC should be moved to ### Agent and
       `bin/fw reviewer T-767 2>&1 | grep -q "Overall:.*PASS"` added to ## Verification.
-->

## Verification

# Shell commands that MUST pass before work-completed. One per line.
# Lines starting with # are comments (skipped). Empty lines ignored.
# The completion gate runs each command — if any exits non-zero, completion is blocked.
#
# Toolchain hint (L-291): if you edited *.vbproj/*.csproj/*.xaml add `dotnet build`;
# *.go → `go build ./...`; Cargo.toml → `cargo check`; tsconfig.json → `tsc --noEmit`;
# pom.xml → `mvn -q compile`. P-011 runs only what you write — broken builds slip
# past otherwise (origin: 003-NTB-ATC-Plugin T-077, broken WPF DLL on master 5 days).
#
# ⚠ ERREXIT WARNING (T-352) — READ BEFORE USING THE CAPTURE PATTERN BELOW.
# P-011 runs each command under `-o pipefail` but NOT under an effective `-e`.
# Measured, not assumed (tools/_t352-p011-errexit-probe.sh): the gate runs each line as
# `if ( … eval "$cmd" ); then` (update-task.sh:1018) and that subshell is the CONDITION
# of an `if`, which neutralises errexit inside it. pipefail survives; errexit does not.
# CONSEQUENCE: a line of the form `a; b` IS JUDGED ON `b` ALONE. `a`'s exit code is
# discarded, so a command that fails outright can still leave the line green.
#   Proven false green:
#     out=$(python3 tools/validate-workflow.py BROKEN.bpmn 2>&1); echo "$out" | grep -q "VALID"
#   -> PASSES on a document the validator exits 2 on and labels INVALID, because
#      `grep -q "VALID"` matches INVALID as a SUBSTRING. Two defects stacked.
# PREFER a single command whose own exit code is the verdict — then no context question
# arises. When you must chain, the LAST command has to be the one that can fail, and its
# pattern must not be matchable by the earlier command's FAILURE output.
# Note `set -e` re-issued inside the subshell does NOT fix this: the suppressed context is
# inherited and re-setting the option does not clear it. See T-352 for the remedy.
#
# Pipefail/SIGPIPE hint (L-387): `cmd | grep -q PATTERN` exits 141 (SIGPIPE) when grep
# matches and closes stdin while the upstream is still writing — verification then
# "fails" even though the pattern was present. The capture pattern below fixes THAT,
# and creates the errexit exposure described above; the file form fixes both:
#     cmd > /tmp/.out 2>&1 && grep -q "PATTERN" /tmp/.out     # PREFERRED: && not ;
#     out=$(cmd 2>&1); echo "$out" | grep -q "PATTERN"        # SIGPIPE-safe, errexit-blind
# Origin: L-387, captured 4× (T-1716, T-1838, T-1862, T-1863) before this hint.
#
# Single pipe only — no intermediate tail/awk/sed stages between capture and grep
# (T-2090): `echo "$out" | tail -3 | grep -q PAT` re-introduces the SIGPIPE risk
# the capture step closed off — the middle stage is what `grep -q` slams its
# stdin on. `echo "$out"` is small and immediate; grep scans the whole captured
# string anyway, so the tail-3 was cosmetic. Drop it: `echo "$out" | grep -q PAT`.
#
# Enforcement-baseline hint (L-398, T-1886): if you edited `.claude/settings.json`
# (added/removed/reorganised hooks), add `bin/fw enforcement baseline` to your
# Verification block. Otherwise the canonical hash diverges and `fw doctor`
# reports a FAIL ("Enforcement baseline CHANGED") that accumulates silently.
# Origin: T-1849/T-1730/T-1731 each added a legitimate hook without refreshing
# the baseline — FAIL sat for multiple sessions until T-1886 cleaned up.

grep -q 'SQ-2' .context/project/decisions.yaml

## RCA

<!-- REQUIRED for bug-class tasks (workflow_type=build with bug-tag, OR title matches
     fix/bug/rca/broken/crash/error/regression/fail/hotfix).
     Non-bug-class tasks may leave this section empty or remove it.

     For bug-class, fill in:
       **Symptom:** what was observed (the user-facing manifestation).
       **Root cause:** the specific structural/logical gap — not "the code was wrong".
       **Why structurally allowed:** what in the framework/code/tooling let this go undetected.
       **Prevention:** what catches the next instance (test/lint/gate/doc/learning) — distinct from the fix itself.

     The completion gate (T-1550, G-019) blocks --status work-completed when
     bug-class AND this section is empty/template-only. Use --skip-rca to bypass (logged).
-->

## Evolution

<!-- REQUIRED for arc-tagged build tasks (tags include arc:*). Captures how
     understanding evolved during build — what was learned that wasn't known at
     filing, what in the original plan no longer fits, what triggered pivots
     or new sub-tasks. Mandatory at slice boundaries (when applicable) and
     before --status work-completed.

     Origin: T-1717 grill Q4 — "the understanding of what we need and want
     evolves with the process of materialisation." Structural counter to §ACD:
     spec-vs-build divergence is logged as soon as it happens, not lost as
     folklore.

     Format (one entry per slice boundary or significant insight):
       ### YYYY-MM-DD — [topic]
       - **What changed:** [what we learned that we didn't know at filing]
       - **Plan impact:** [what in the plan no longer fits]
       - **Triggered:** [new sub-task / pivot / scope cut, with task ID if filed]

     The completion gate (T-1718) blocks --status work-completed when this
     section exists but is empty/template-only. Use --skip-evolution to bypass
     (logged Tier-2). Non-arc tasks may leave this empty.
-->

## Decisions

<!-- Record decisions ONLY when choosing between alternatives.
     Skip for tasks with no meaningful choices.
     Format:
     ### [date] — [topic]
     - **Chose:** [what was decided]
     - **Why:** [rationale]
     - **Rejected:** [alternatives and why not]
-->

## Decision

<!-- Filled at completion of inception tasks via:
     fw inception decide T-767 go|no-go|defer --rationale "..."

     For non-inception tasks this section is ignored. Kept in template
     so `fw inception decide` (lib/inception.sh) finds the anchor heading
     without auto-creating; T-1832 added auto-create as fallback for
     legacy tasks lacking this section. -->
