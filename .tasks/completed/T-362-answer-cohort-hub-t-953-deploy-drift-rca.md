# T-362: Answer cohort-hub T-953 deploy-drift RCA: route to endpoint owner, report version-ordinal defect in proposed audit

## Context

cohort-hub (002-Claude-Partner-Network) posted an RCA to `agent-chat-arc` (offset 10910)
addressed to `workflow-designer`, reporting that 5 of 18 BPMN map slots are stale or absent
on the designer at `.107:3100`, and asking which of three prevention options we will take.

The deliverable is an **answer**, not a build: their numbers verified independently, the
ask routed to the component's actual owner with evidence, and one defect in their own
proposed remedy reported. Full write-up in
`docs/reports/T-362-cohort-hub-deploy-drift-answer.md`; posted to the rail at offset 10916.

Scope deliberately excludes implementing any of Options A/B/C — the endpoint is AEF's, and
per the pickup-message rule a detailed proposal is not authorization to build.

## Acceptance Criteria

### Agent
<!-- Criteria the agent can verify (code, tests, commands). P-010 gates on these. -->
- [x] Their 5 drift rows reproduced independently against the live server, not taken on trust
      (`/api/list` on .107: cohort-onboarding latest=9, pen-contract-cohort-forwarder=6,
      three slots absent from a 15-map list)
- [x] The competing hypothesis tested and DISPROVED by measurement rather than dismissed —
      the T-301 slug fork would have given the STALE rows a second, designer-side cause;
      zero underscore slugs exist on .107, so their single root cause stands alone
- [x] Endpoint ownership established from evidence, not assumed: `/api/health` returns the
      literal emitted at `designer_api.py:108`, the file's docstring names AEF as owner, and
      it arrived by vendoring (T-276). The limit of "not mine" is stated too (G-008 lets me
      patch the vendored copy — it just would not help them)
- [x] The ordinal defect in their proposed remedy identified and shown to be contract-level,
      by citing the version assignment in BOTH implementations (`designer_api.py:138` and
      our own `tools/gallery-serve.py:627`), not just AEF's
- [x] The replacement recipe (content-sha over `/api/version`) PROVEN to discriminate before
      being handed over — run against two versions known to differ, distinct shas
- [x] Answer posted to the rail (agent-chat-arc offset 10916) and written up in
      `docs/reports/T-362-cohort-hub-deploy-drift-answer.md`

### Human
<!-- Criteria requiring human verification (UI/UX, subjective quality). Not blocking.
     Remove this section if all criteria are agent-verifiable.
     Each criterion MUST include Steps/Expected/If-not so the human can act without guessing.

     ── Prefix routing (T-1811, T-1878): default to [REVIEWER] if Expected is grep-able ──
     If your Expected clause is grep-able / file-exists / structural (a deterministic
     shell check), prefer [REVIEWER] — that AC should be an Agent AC with the reviewer
     command in `## Verification` instead of a Human AC here. Only keep [REVIEW] if
     verification genuinely needs human taste (tone, feel, layout rhythm).
     See CLAUDE.md §AC Classification Guidance for the conversion rule.

     [REVIEW] example (genuine human judgment):
       - [ ] [REVIEW] Dashboard renders correctly
         **Steps:**
         1. Open https://example.com/dashboard in browser
         2. Verify all panels load within 2 seconds
         3. Check browser console for errors
         **Expected:** All panels visible, no console errors
         **If not:** Screenshot the broken panel and note the console error

     [REVIEWER] example (static-scan-verifiable — convert to Agent AC + Verification):
       - [ ] [REVIEWER] Block message names both bypass mechanisms
         **Steps:**
         1. Run `bin/fw reviewer T-XXX`
         **Expected:** Verdict: PASS; no findings on `block-message-completeness`
         **If not:** Inspect hook block-message string and add missing mechanism
       Conversion: this AC should be moved to ### Agent and
       `bin/fw reviewer T-XXX 2>&1 | grep -q "Overall:.*PASS"` added to ## Verification.
-->

## Verification

# Shell commands that MUST pass before work-completed. One per line.
# Lines starting with # are comments (skipped). Empty lines ignored.
# The completion gate runs each command — if any exits non-zero, completion is blocked.
#
# Toolchain hint (L-291): if you edited *.vbproj/*.csproj/*.xaml add `dotnet build`;
# *.go → `go build ./...`; Cargo.toml → `cargo check`; tsconfig.json → `tsc --noEmit`;
# pom.xml → `mvn -q compile`. P-011 runs only what you write — broken builds slip
# past otherwise (origin: 003-NTB-ATC-Plugin T-077, broken WPF DLL on master 5 days).
#
# ⚠ ERREXIT WARNING (T-352) — READ BEFORE USING THE CAPTURE PATTERN BELOW.
# P-011 runs each command under `-o pipefail` but NOT under an effective `-e`.
# Measured, not assumed (tools/_t352-p011-errexit-probe.sh): the gate runs each line as
# `if ( … eval "$cmd" ); then` (update-task.sh:1018) and that subshell is the CONDITION
# of an `if`, which neutralises errexit inside it. pipefail survives; errexit does not.
# CONSEQUENCE: a line of the form `a; b` IS JUDGED ON `b` ALONE. `a`'s exit code is
# discarded, so a command that fails outright can still leave the line green.
#   Proven false green:
#     out=$(python3 tools/validate-workflow.py BROKEN.bpmn 2>&1); echo "$out" | grep -q "VALID"
#   -> PASSES on a document the validator exits 2 on and labels INVALID, because
#      `grep -q "VALID"` matches INVALID as a SUBSTRING. Two defects stacked.
# PREFER a single command whose own exit code is the verdict — then no context question
# arises. When you must chain, the LAST command has to be the one that can fail, and its
# pattern must not be matchable by the earlier command's FAILURE output.
# Note `set -e` re-issued inside the subshell does NOT fix this: the suppressed context is
# inherited and re-setting the option does not clear it. See T-352 for the remedy.
#
# Pipefail/SIGPIPE hint (L-387): `cmd | grep -q PATTERN` exits 141 (SIGPIPE) when grep
# matches and closes stdin while the upstream is still writing — verification then
# "fails" even though the pattern was present. The capture pattern below fixes THAT,
# and creates the errexit exposure described above; the file form fixes both:
#     cmd > /tmp/.out 2>&1 && grep -q "PATTERN" /tmp/.out     # PREFERRED: && not ;
#     out=$(cmd 2>&1); echo "$out" | grep -q "PATTERN"        # SIGPIPE-safe, errexit-blind
# Origin: L-387, captured 4× (T-1716, T-1838, T-1862, T-1863) before this hint.
#
# Single pipe only — no intermediate tail/awk/sed stages between capture and grep
# (T-2090): `echo "$out" | tail -3 | grep -q PAT` re-introduces the SIGPIPE risk
# the capture step closed off — the middle stage is what `grep -q` slams its
# stdin on. `echo "$out"` is small and immediate; grep scans the whole captured
# string anyway, so the tail-3 was cosmetic. Drop it: `echo "$out" | grep -q PAT`.
#
# Enforcement-baseline hint (L-398, T-1886): if you edited `.claude/settings.json`
# (added/removed/reorganised hooks), add `bin/fw enforcement baseline` to your
# Verification block. Otherwise the canonical hash diverges and `fw doctor`
# reports a FAIL ("Enforcement baseline CHANGED") that accumulates silently.
# Origin: T-1849/T-1730/T-1731 each added a legitimate hook without refreshing
# the baseline — FAIL sat for multiple sessions until T-1886 cleaned up.
#
# T-362 note: no line here probes .107:3100. The answer's numbers were measured
# against that host, but a third party's server being up is not a property of
# this repository — gating completion on it would make P-011 fail for a reason
# that has nothing to do with the deliverable. What IS asserted is the pair of
# in-tree code facts the answer's central claim rests on: if either emitter stops
# assigning versions from its own store, the advice posted to the rail is wrong
# and should go red. Patterns, not line numbers, so an unrelated edit above them
# does not manufacture a failure.
out=$(grep -c 'v = int(meta.get("latest") or 0) + 1' .agentic-framework/web/blueprints/designer_api.py); [ "$out" = "1" ]
out=$(grep -c "max(\[e.get('v', 0) for e in index\]) + 1" tools/gallery-serve.py); [ "$out" = "1" ]
test -f docs/reports/T-362-cohort-hub-deploy-drift-answer.md
out=$(cat docs/reports/T-362-cohort-hub-deploy-drift-answer.md); echo "$out" | grep -q "PASS — distinct content yields distinct sha"

## RCA

<!-- REQUIRED for bug-class tasks (workflow_type=build with bug-tag, OR title matches
     fix/bug/rca/broken/crash/error/regression/fail/hotfix).
     Non-bug-class tasks may leave this section empty or remove it.

     For bug-class, fill in:
       **Symptom:** what was observed (the user-facing manifestation).
       **Root cause:** the specific structural/logical gap — not "the code was wrong".
       **Why structurally allowed:** what in the framework/code/tooling let this go undetected.
       **Prevention:** what catches the next instance (test/lint/gate/doc/learning) — distinct from the fix itself.

     The completion gate (T-1550, G-019) blocks --status work-completed when
     bug-class AND this section is empty/template-only. Use --skip-rca to bypass (logged).
-->

## Evolution

<!-- REQUIRED for arc-tagged build tasks (tags include arc:*). Captures how
     understanding evolved during build — what was learned that wasn't known at
     filing, what in the original plan no longer fits, what triggered pivots
     or new sub-tasks. Mandatory at slice boundaries (when applicable) and
     before --status work-completed.

     Origin: T-1717 grill Q4 — "the understanding of what we need and want
     evolves with the process of materialisation." Structural counter to §ACD:
     spec-vs-build divergence is logged as soon as it happens, not lost as
     folklore.

     Format (one entry per slice boundary or significant insight):
       ### YYYY-MM-DD — [topic]
       - **What changed:** [what we learned that we didn't know at filing]
       - **Plan impact:** [what in the plan no longer fits]
       - **Triggered:** [new sub-task / pivot / scope cut, with task ID if filed]

     The completion gate (T-1718) blocks --status work-completed when this
     section exists but is empty/template-only. Use --skip-evolution to bypass
     (logged Tier-2). Non-arc tasks may leave this empty.
-->

## Decisions

<!-- Record decisions ONLY when choosing between alternatives.
     Skip for tasks with no meaningful choices.
     Format:
     ### [date] — [topic]
     - **Chose:** [what was decided]
     - **Why:** [rationale]
     - **Rejected:** [alternatives and why not]
-->

## Decision

<!-- Filled at completion of inception tasks via:
     fw inception decide T-XXX go|no-go|defer --rationale "..."

     For non-inception tasks this section is ignored. Kept in template
     so `fw inception decide` (lib/inception.sh) finds the anchor heading
     without auto-creating; T-1832 added auto-create as fallback for
     legacy tasks lacking this section. -->
