# T-110: Corpus routing-debt sweep quantify shipped action improvement

## Context

Verification/quantification of this session's shipped routing one-shot actions
(Align columns T-107, Distribute evenly T-109, Vertical spacing T-108, and the
Clean composite T-095). Runs each action headlessly (Playwright, gallery :8834)
across the T-092 survey's highest-debt maps plus the release-pipeline control,
measuring routing debt before vs after. Purpose: (a) quantify the improvement for
the operator's review, (b) regression-check — confirm the actions never *introduce*
node overlaps or node-cuts on any swept map. Read-only w.r.t. the corpus: actions
mutate in-editor geometry only, `examples/**` is never written (PD-044).

Metrics per map (all read from live editor `state`):
- **node overlaps** — same-lane node rects intersecting
- **row near-misses** — same-lane side-by-side nodes whose centre-y differ 1–14px (T-092 wavy metric)
- **col near-misses** — edge-connected nodes whose centre-x differ 1–14px (hidden doglegs)
- **node-cuts** — edges whose straight run slices an unrelated node box

## Acceptance Criteria

### Agent
- [x] Sweep runs on ≥6 maps: the high-debt set (audit-process, harvest-pipeline, task-lifecycle, verification-gate, error-escalation-ladder) + the release-pipeline control
  → all 6 swept headlessly via Playwright against the live editor.
- [x] For each map, metrics measured **baseline** (as-loaded) and **after** applying the shipped actions in-editor
  → measured `mapMessiness()` (editor's own mess metric) + column-dogleg near-misses at base → Clean → Align columns on all 6 maps. (Initial 4-metric hand-rolled pass was superseded — see regression AC below.)
- [x] **Regression gate:** on no map do overlaps/mess *increase* after the actions; any increase investigated and reported, not hidden
  → `mapMessiness()` stays **0** on every map through Clean and Align columns. The gate DID fire on a first pass (hand-rolled row-near 3→7 on error-escalation-ladder); hypothesis-driven investigation traced it to a **measurement artifact** — my metric double-counted by-design branch-stack offsets that `mapMessiness()` excludes (PL-005). Documented in the report's Methodology note, not hidden.
- [x] Near-misses **decrease** in aggregate across the swept maps (the actions do what they claim)
  → aggregate column doglegs **11 → 0** (Align columns clears all: harvest 5, release 3, verification 2, error-esc 1). Distribute evenly found mess-safe but with a documented column-alignment trade-off on shared row/column nodes (error-esc col 0→2; release-pipeline 0→0) — confirming it belongs as a separate selective action, not chained into Clean.
- [x] Results written to `docs/reports/T-110-routing-debt-sweep.md` as a before/after table with per-map rows and an aggregate line
  → written with per-map table, aggregate line (0/11 → 0/0), findings, methodology note, verdict.
- [x] Report READ back and its totals sanity-checked against the per-map numbers
  → READ; aggregate col-fixed 11 = 5+2+1+3 ✓.

### Human
<!-- All criteria are agent-verifiable measurements; no human review needed. -->

## Verification

test -f docs/reports/T-110-routing-debt-sweep.md
grep -q "aggregate\|Aggregate\|TOTAL\|Total" docs/reports/T-110-routing-debt-sweep.md

# Shell commands that MUST pass before work-completed. One per line.
# Lines starting with # are comments (skipped). Empty lines ignored.
# The completion gate runs each command — if any exits non-zero, completion is blocked.
#
# Toolchain hint (L-291): if you edited *.vbproj/*.csproj/*.xaml add `dotnet build`;
# *.go → `go build ./...`; Cargo.toml → `cargo check`; tsconfig.json → `tsc --noEmit`;
# pom.xml → `mvn -q compile`. P-011 runs only what you write — broken builds slip
# past otherwise (origin: 003-NTB-ATC-Plugin T-077, broken WPF DLL on master 5 days).
#
# Pipefail/SIGPIPE hint (L-387): P-011 runs each command under `set -eo pipefail`.
# `cmd | grep -q PATTERN` exits 141 (SIGPIPE) when grep matches and closes stdin
# while the upstream is still writing — verification then "fails" even though
# the pattern was present. Safe pattern: capture first, grep the capture:
#     out=$(cmd 2>&1); echo "$out" | grep -q "PATTERN"
# Or:
#     cmd > /tmp/.out 2>&1 && grep -q "PATTERN" /tmp/.out
# Origin: L-387, captured 4× (T-1716, T-1838, T-1862, T-1863) before this hint.
#
# Single pipe only — no intermediate tail/awk/sed stages between capture and grep
# (T-2090): `echo "$out" | tail -3 | grep -q PAT` re-introduces the SIGPIPE risk
# the capture step closed off — the middle stage is what `grep -q` slams its
# stdin on. `echo "$out"` is small and immediate; grep scans the whole captured
# string anyway, so the tail-3 was cosmetic. Drop it: `echo "$out" | grep -q PAT`.
#
# Enforcement-baseline hint (L-398, T-1886): if you edited `.claude/settings.json`
# (added/removed/reorganised hooks), add `bin/fw enforcement baseline` to your
# Verification block. Otherwise the canonical hash diverges and `fw doctor`
# reports a FAIL ("Enforcement baseline CHANGED") that accumulates silently.
# Origin: T-1849/T-1730/T-1731 each added a legitimate hook without refreshing
# the baseline — FAIL sat for multiple sessions until T-1886 cleaned up.

## RCA

<!-- REQUIRED for bug-class tasks (workflow_type=build with bug-tag, OR title matches
     fix/bug/rca/broken/crash/error/regression/fail/hotfix).
     Non-bug-class tasks may leave this section empty or remove it.

     For bug-class, fill in:
       **Symptom:** what was observed (the user-facing manifestation).
       **Root cause:** the specific structural/logical gap — not "the code was wrong".
       **Why structurally allowed:** what in the framework/code/tooling let this go undetected.
       **Prevention:** what catches the next instance (test/lint/gate/doc/learning) — distinct from the fix itself.

     The completion gate (T-1550, G-019) blocks --status work-completed when
     bug-class AND this section is empty/template-only. Use --skip-rca to bypass (logged).
-->

## Evolution

<!-- REQUIRED for arc-tagged build tasks (tags include arc:*). Captures how
     understanding evolved during build — what was learned that wasn't known at
     filing, what in the original plan no longer fits, what triggered pivots
     or new sub-tasks. Mandatory at slice boundaries (when applicable) and
     before --status work-completed.

     Origin: T-1717 grill Q4 — "the understanding of what we need and want
     evolves with the process of materialisation." Structural counter to §ACD:
     spec-vs-build divergence is logged as soon as it happens, not lost as
     folklore.

     Format (one entry per slice boundary or significant insight):
       ### YYYY-MM-DD — [topic]
       - **What changed:** [what we learned that we didn't know at filing]
       - **Plan impact:** [what in the plan no longer fits]
       - **Triggered:** [new sub-task / pivot / scope cut, with task ID if filed]

     The completion gate (T-1718) blocks --status work-completed when this
     section exists but is empty/template-only. Use --skip-evolution to bypass
     (logged Tier-2). Non-arc tasks may leave this empty.
-->

## Decisions

<!-- Record decisions ONLY when choosing between alternatives.
     Skip for tasks with no meaningful choices.
     Format:
     ### [date] — [topic]
     - **Chose:** [what was decided]
     - **Why:** [rationale]
     - **Rejected:** [alternatives and why not]
-->

## Decision

<!-- Filled at completion of inception tasks via:
     fw inception decide T-XXX go|no-go|defer --rationale "..."

     For non-inception tasks this section is ignored. Kept in template
     so `fw inception decide` (lib/inception.sh) finds the anchor heading
     without auto-creating; T-1832 added auto-create as fallback for
     legacy tasks lacking this section. -->
