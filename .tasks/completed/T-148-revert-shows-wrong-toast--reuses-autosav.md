# T-148: Revert shows wrong toast — reuses autosave-restore banner

## Context

T-146 finding F1. `revertToVersion` (src:6877) confirmed a version revert by
calling `showRestoredToast`, which always renders "↩ Restored your unsaved work"
plus a **Start fresh** button that wipes the doc (`createNewWorkflow`). So
reverting to v1 mislabelled itself as an autosave-restore and offered a
destructive action. Fix: give revert its own accurate, action-free confirmation
by extracting a generic `showToast(message, opts)` and routing both callers
through it.

## Acceptance Criteria

### Agent
<!-- Criteria the agent can verify (code, tests, commands). P-010 gates on these. -->
- [x] Generic `showToast(message, {actionLabel,onAction,timeout})` helper added; `showRestoredToast` becomes a thin wrapper (restore message + "Start fresh" action) — behaviour unchanged for autosave-restore
- [x] `revertToVersion` shows `↩ Reverted to <id> v<N>` with NO "Start fresh" button (no doc-wipe action on a revert)
- [x] `src` mirrored to `build/gallery/designer.html` (diff -q clean)
- [x] Visual: screenshot the revert toast; message reads "Reverted to …", no Start-fresh button (see ## Visual Verification)

## Visual Verification

- `.playwright-mcp/t148-revert-toast-v2.png` — after reverting arc-lifecycle to v2:
  bottom-center toast reads **"↩ Reverted to arc-lifecycle v2."** with **no** action
  button; canvas shows v2 geometry. DOM assert: `{toastText:"↩ Reverted to
  arc-lifecycle v2.", hasActionButton:false}`.
- Autosave-restore path unchanged: `showRestoredToast` still routes through the new
  `showToast` with the "Start fresh" action (message + action preserved).

<!-- No Human ACs — deterministic toast copy/action, agent-verified (DOM + screenshot). -->

## Verification

diff -q src/aef-workflow-designer.html build/gallery/designer.html
grep -q 'Reverted to ${id} v${v}' src/aef-workflow-designer.html
grep -q 'function showToast(message, opts)' src/aef-workflow-designer.html
# revert must NOT call the restore banner anymore:
! grep -q 'showRestoredToast({ ts: Date.now' src/aef-workflow-designer.html

# Shell commands that MUST pass before work-completed. One per line.
# Lines starting with # are comments (skipped). Empty lines ignored.
# The completion gate runs each command — if any exits non-zero, completion is blocked.
#
# Toolchain hint (L-291): if you edited *.vbproj/*.csproj/*.xaml add `dotnet build`;
# *.go → `go build ./...`; Cargo.toml → `cargo check`; tsconfig.json → `tsc --noEmit`;
# pom.xml → `mvn -q compile`. P-011 runs only what you write — broken builds slip
# past otherwise (origin: 003-NTB-ATC-Plugin T-077, broken WPF DLL on master 5 days).
#
# Pipefail/SIGPIPE hint (L-387): P-011 runs each command under `set -eo pipefail`.
# `cmd | grep -q PATTERN` exits 141 (SIGPIPE) when grep matches and closes stdin
# while the upstream is still writing — verification then "fails" even though
# the pattern was present. Safe pattern: capture first, grep the capture:
#     out=$(cmd 2>&1); echo "$out" | grep -q "PATTERN"
# Or:
#     cmd > /tmp/.out 2>&1 && grep -q "PATTERN" /tmp/.out
# Origin: L-387, captured 4× (T-1716, T-1838, T-1862, T-1863) before this hint.
#
# Single pipe only — no intermediate tail/awk/sed stages between capture and grep
# (T-2090): `echo "$out" | tail -3 | grep -q PAT` re-introduces the SIGPIPE risk
# the capture step closed off — the middle stage is what `grep -q` slams its
# stdin on. `echo "$out"` is small and immediate; grep scans the whole captured
# string anyway, so the tail-3 was cosmetic. Drop it: `echo "$out" | grep -q PAT`.
#
# Enforcement-baseline hint (L-398, T-1886): if you edited `.claude/settings.json`
# (added/removed/reorganised hooks), add `bin/fw enforcement baseline` to your
# Verification block. Otherwise the canonical hash diverges and `fw doctor`
# reports a FAIL ("Enforcement baseline CHANGED") that accumulates silently.
# Origin: T-1849/T-1730/T-1731 each added a legitimate hook without refreshing
# the baseline — FAIL sat for multiple sessions until T-1886 cleaned up.

## RCA

<!-- REQUIRED for bug-class tasks (workflow_type=build with bug-tag, OR title matches
     fix/bug/rca/broken/crash/error/regression/fail/hotfix).
     Non-bug-class tasks may leave this section empty or remove it.

     For bug-class, fill in:
       **Symptom:** what was observed (the user-facing manifestation).
       **Root cause:** the specific structural/logical gap — not "the code was wrong".
       **Why structurally allowed:** what in the framework/code/tooling let this go undetected.
       **Prevention:** what catches the next instance (test/lint/gate/doc/learning) — distinct from the fix itself.

     The completion gate (T-1550, G-019) blocks --status work-completed when
     bug-class AND this section is empty/template-only. Use --skip-rca to bypass (logged).
-->

**Symptom:** Reverting to a saved version showed "↩ Restored your unsaved work
(<now>)" with a "Start fresh" button — wrong copy and a destructive action.

**Root cause:** `revertToVersion` reused `showRestoredToast`, a toast hard-wired
to the autosave-restore message + a `createNewWorkflow` "Start fresh" action. The
`title` it passed was ignored. One toast function served two semantically
different events.

**Why structurally allowed:** A single-purpose UI helper (autosave-restore) was
reused for a second event without parameterising its message/action — no type or
test distinguishes "restore" from "revert" copy.

**Prevention:** Generic `showToast(message, opts)` now separates message + optional
action per caller; Verification greps assert revert uses the new confirmation and
no longer calls the restore banner.

## Evolution

<!-- REQUIRED for arc-tagged build tasks (tags include arc:*). Captures how
     understanding evolved during build — what was learned that wasn't known at
     filing, what in the original plan no longer fits, what triggered pivots
     or new sub-tasks. Mandatory at slice boundaries (when applicable) and
     before --status work-completed.

     Origin: T-1717 grill Q4 — "the understanding of what we need and want
     evolves with the process of materialisation." Structural counter to §ACD:
     spec-vs-build divergence is logged as soon as it happens, not lost as
     folklore.

     Format (one entry per slice boundary or significant insight):
       ### YYYY-MM-DD — [topic]
       - **What changed:** [what we learned that we didn't know at filing]
       - **Plan impact:** [what in the plan no longer fits]
       - **Triggered:** [new sub-task / pivot / scope cut, with task ID if filed]

     The completion gate (T-1718) blocks --status work-completed when this
     section exists but is empty/template-only. Use --skip-evolution to bypass
     (logged Tier-2). Non-arc tasks may leave this empty.
-->

## Decisions

<!-- Record decisions ONLY when choosing between alternatives.
     Skip for tasks with no meaningful choices.
     Format:
     ### [date] — [topic]
     - **Chose:** [what was decided]
     - **Why:** [rationale]
     - **Rejected:** [alternatives and why not]
-->

## Decision

<!-- Filled at completion of inception tasks via:
     fw inception decide T-XXX go|no-go|defer --rationale "..."

     For non-inception tasks this section is ignored. Kept in template
     so `fw inception decide` (lib/inception.sh) finds the anchor heading
     without auto-creating; T-1832 added auto-create as fallback for
     legacy tasks lacking this section. -->
