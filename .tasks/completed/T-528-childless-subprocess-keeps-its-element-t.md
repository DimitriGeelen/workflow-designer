# T-528: childless subProcess keeps its element type and extensionElements across a round-trip (AEF rail 11926 third arm)

## Context

AEF answered rail 11916 at 11926/11930: **their model does not represent scope.** `subProcess`
appears in three published maps and three drafts; parsed rather than grepped, every one is
childless — `children={'extensionElements': 1}`, zero contained flow nodes. Containment is never
load-bearing for them, so T-523's hoisting is a non-issue. "Hoist away."

They ruled out the confound rather than inferring past it, which is why the answer is usable:
"empty" is exactly what a child-eating defect in MY editor would produce, so clearing me on the
strength of my own damage was the available mistake. They ruled it out on their own recorded
history — commit `226fe8680`, *"G-3 collapsed-subProcess dialect round-trips"* — plus the absence
of `isExpanded` on any DI shape. The emptiness is design, not residue.

**What they actually depend on is the property NEXT to the one I measured, and my coverage of it
is zero.** Their dialect uses `subProcess` as a *typed marker carrying `extensionElements`*. They
do not need children to survive; they need the ELEMENT TYPE to survive as `subProcess`, with its
`extensionElements` attached. If a round-trip helpfully rewrites a childless `subProcess` into a
`task` — defensible, arguably a cleanup — their dialect dies silently and every collapsed node in
three published maps degrades to an untyped activity.

Both existing arms of `tools/_t523-subprocess-nesting.mjs` inject subProcesses **with** children,
so the childless case never appears. Childless is their entire population: the current pair covers
0% of their real usage. That is not a defect in the probe — it measured containment and it
measured containment correctly — it is a coverage gap that only their corpus could reveal.

This adds the third arm. The outcome is genuinely unknown: if the editor retypes a childless
subProcess, that is a live finding against three published AEF maps and must be relayed
immediately rather than filed.

Independent of T-3018 by AEF's explicit statement ("a fact about our corpus you can act on or
ignore independently"), so it is not blocked on their operator.

## Acceptance Criteria

### Agent
- [x] A third arm `collapsed` is added: a childless `<bpmn:subProcess>` carrying
      `extensionElements` (uid + position), with NO flowElement children and NO sequenceFlow —
      the shape AEF actually publishes, not the shape convenient to test.
- [x] The arm asserts ELEMENT-TYPE survival, not merely uid survival: after the round-trip the
      uid's owner localname is compared, and a rewrite to `task`/any other activity is reported
      as its own outcome (`survived-retyped`, naming the new owner) rather than folded into
      "survived". A probe that answers "the uid came back" answers a question AEF did not ask.
- [x] Stimulus check BEFORE the round-trip (PL-206): the arm REFUSES unless the injected document
      really contains a subProcess-owned uid with ZERO contained flow nodes. An arm that silently
      staged a non-childless subProcess would report on the population it was built to exclude.
- [x] The existing per-arm negative control is retained for the new arm — if the untouched
      control uid does not survive an ordinary round-trip, the run is a statement about a broken
      round-trip and not about subProcess typing, and must refuse rather than fault the editor.
- [x] The new arm's result is pinned from a MEASURED run, never from expectation: an absent
      `collapsed` pin REFUSES (rc 2) rather than passing, so "I have no reference" cannot look
      like "it matched".
- [x] The two existing arms are unchanged in behaviour — their pinned summaries do not move.
      Adding coverage must not silently restate the finding AEF has already acted on.
- [x] The measured result is relayed to AEF on the rail whichever way it goes, since they are
      deciding what to build on the basis of it. A negative result is the more urgent relay.
- [x] Suite still green and the T-451 census ratchet unmoved at 67.

### Human
<!-- Criteria requiring human verification (UI/UX, subjective quality). Not blocking.
     Remove this section if all criteria are agent-verifiable.
     Each criterion MUST include Steps/Expected/If-not so the human can act without guessing.

     ── Prefix routing (T-1811, T-1878): default to [REVIEWER] if Expected is grep-able ──
     If your Expected clause is grep-able / file-exists / structural (a deterministic
     shell check), prefer [REVIEWER] — that AC should be an Agent AC with the reviewer
     command in `## Verification` instead of a Human AC here. Only keep [REVIEW] if
     verification genuinely needs human taste (tone, feel, layout rhythm).
     See CLAUDE.md §AC Classification Guidance for the conversion rule.

     [REVIEW] example (genuine human judgment):
       - [ ] [REVIEW] Dashboard renders correctly
         **Steps:**
         1. Open https://example.com/dashboard in browser
         2. Verify all panels load within 2 seconds
         3. Check browser console for errors
         **Expected:** All panels visible, no console errors
         **If not:** Screenshot the broken panel and note the console error

     [REVIEWER] example (static-scan-verifiable — convert to Agent AC + Verification):
       - [ ] [REVIEWER] Block message names both bypass mechanisms
         **Steps:**
         1. Run `bin/fw reviewer T-XXX`
         **Expected:** Verdict: PASS; no findings on `block-message-completeness`
         **If not:** Inspect hook block-message string and add missing mechanism
       Conversion: this AC should be moved to ### Agent and
       `bin/fw reviewer T-XXX 2>&1 | grep -q "Overall:.*PASS"` added to ## Verification.

## Verification

# Shell commands that MUST pass before work-completed. One per line.
# Lines starting with # are comments (skipped). Empty lines ignored.
# The completion gate runs each command — if any exits non-zero, completion is blocked.
#
# Toolchain hint (L-291): if you edited *.vbproj/*.csproj/*.xaml add `dotnet build`;
# *.go → `go build ./...`; Cargo.toml → `cargo check`; tsconfig.json → `tsc --noEmit`;
# pom.xml → `mvn -q compile`. P-011 runs only what you write — broken builds slip
# past otherwise (origin: 003-NTB-ATC-Plugin T-077, broken WPF DLL on master 5 days).
#
# ⚠ ERREXIT WARNING (T-352) — READ BEFORE USING THE CAPTURE PATTERN BELOW.
# P-011 runs each command under `-o pipefail` but NOT under an effective `-e`.
# Measured, not assumed (tools/_t352-p011-errexit-probe.sh): the gate runs each line as
# `if ( … eval "$cmd" ); then` (update-task.sh:1018) and that subshell is the CONDITION
# of an `if`, which neutralises errexit inside it. pipefail survives; errexit does not.
# CONSEQUENCE: a line of the form `a; b` IS JUDGED ON `b` ALONE. `a`'s exit code is
# discarded, so a command that fails outright can still leave the line green.
#   Proven false green:
#     out=$(python3 tools/validate-workflow.py BROKEN.bpmn 2>&1); echo "$out" | grep -q "VALID"
#   -> PASSES on a document the validator exits 2 on and labels INVALID, because
#      `grep -q "VALID"` matches INVALID as a SUBSTRING. Two defects stacked.
# PREFER a single command whose own exit code is the verdict — then no context question
# arises. When you must chain, the LAST command has to be the one that can fail, and its
# pattern must not be matchable by the earlier command's FAILURE output.
# Note `set -e` re-issued inside the subshell does NOT fix this: the suppressed context is
# inherited and re-setting the option does not clear it. See T-352 for the remedy.

# The probe agrees with its pin, INCLUDING the new collapsed arm. rc 2 here is a refusal
# (no pin, no corpus, staging failed), not a pass — the gate reads the exit code, so both
# failure shapes block completion, which is the intended behaviour.
timeout 300 node tools/_t523-subprocess-nesting.mjs > /dev/null 2>&1
# And the teeth, because a green arm that cannot go red would certify AEF's three published
# maps on nothing. Legs 7-9 are the new ones: retype detected, named, and localised.
timeout 900 python3 tools/_t523-nesting-teeth.py > /dev/null 2>&1
# The collapsed arm must actually be pinned. An arm whose pin key is missing REFUSES rather
# than passing, but a pin file silently reverted would leave the suite asserting two arms
# while the task claims three.
python3 -c "import json; d=json.load(open('tools/_t523-nesting.pin.json')); assert d['collapsed']['node']['owner']=='subProcess' and d['collapsed']['children_after']==0"

# third that nothing calls.
python3 tools/_t451-unwired-guard-census.py --ratchet
#
# Pipefail/SIGPIPE hint (L-387): `cmd | grep -q PATTERN` exits 141 (SIGPIPE) when grep
# matches and closes stdin while the upstream is still writing — verification then
# "fails" even though the pattern was present. The capture pattern below fixes THAT,
# and creates the errexit exposure described above; the file form fixes both:
#     cmd > /tmp/.out 2>&1 && grep -q "PATTERN" /tmp/.out     # PREFERRED: && not ;
#     out=$(cmd 2>&1); echo "$out" | grep -q "PATTERN"        # SIGPIPE-safe, errexit-blind
# Origin: L-387, captured 4× (T-1716, T-1838, T-1862, T-1863) before this hint.
#
# Single pipe only — no intermediate tail/awk/sed stages between capture and grep
# (T-2090): `echo "$out" | tail -3 | grep -q PAT` re-introduces the SIGPIPE risk
# the capture step closed off — the middle stage is what `grep -q` slams its
# stdin on. `echo "$out"` is small and immediate; grep scans the whole captured
# string anyway, so the tail-3 was cosmetic. Drop it: `echo "$out" | grep -q PAT`.
#
# Enforcement-baseline hint (L-398, T-1886): if you edited `.claude/settings.json`
# (added/removed/reorganised hooks), add `bin/fw enforcement baseline` to your
# Verification block. Otherwise the canonical hash diverges and `fw doctor`
# reports a FAIL ("Enforcement baseline CHANGED") that accumulates silently.
# Origin: T-1849/T-1730/T-1731 each added a legitimate hook without refreshing
# the baseline — FAIL sat for multiple sessions until T-1886 cleaned up.

## RCA

<!-- REQUIRED for bug-class tasks (workflow_type=build with bug-tag, OR title matches
     fix/bug/rca/broken/crash/error/regression/fail/hotfix).
     Non-bug-class tasks may leave this section empty or remove it.

     For bug-class, fill in:
       **Symptom:** what was observed (the user-facing manifestation).
       **Root cause:** the specific structural/logical gap — not "the code was wrong".
       **Why structurally allowed:** what in the framework/code/tooling let this go undetected.
       **Prevention:** what catches the next instance (test/lint/gate/doc/learning) — distinct from the fix itself.

     The completion gate (T-1550, G-019) blocks --status work-completed when
     bug-class AND this section is empty/template-only. Use --skip-rca to bypass (logged).

## Evolution

<!-- REQUIRED for arc-tagged build tasks (tags include arc:*). Captures how
     understanding evolved during build — what was learned that wasn't known at
     filing, what in the original plan no longer fits, what triggered pivots
     or new sub-tasks. Mandatory at slice boundaries (when applicable) and
     before --status work-completed.

     Origin: T-1717 grill Q4 — "the understanding of what we need and want
     evolves with the process of materialisation." Structural counter to §ACD:
     spec-vs-build divergence is logged as soon as it happens, not lost as
     folklore.

     Format (one entry per slice boundary or significant insight):
       ### YYYY-MM-DD — [topic]
       - **What changed:** [what we learned that we didn't know at filing]
       - **Plan impact:** [what in the plan no longer fits]
       - **Triggered:** [new sub-task / pivot / scope cut, with task ID if filed]

     The completion gate (T-1718) blocks --status work-completed when this
     section exists but is empty/template-only. Use --skip-evolution to bypass
     (logged Tier-2). Non-arc tasks may leave this empty.

## Decisions

<!-- Record decisions ONLY when choosing between alternatives.
     Skip for tasks with no meaningful choices.
     Format:
     ### [date] — [topic]
     - **Chose:** [what was decided]
     - **Why:** [rationale]
     - **Rejected:** [alternatives and why not]

## Decision

<!-- Filled at completion of inception tasks via:
     fw inception decide T-XXX go|no-go|defer --rationale "..."

     For non-inception tasks this section is ignored. Kept in template
     so `fw inception decide` (lib/inception.sh) finds the anchor heading
     without auto-creating; T-1832 added auto-create as fallback for
     legacy tasks lacking this section. -->
