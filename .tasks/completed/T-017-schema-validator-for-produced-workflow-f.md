# T-017: Schema validator for produced workflow files

## Context

Post-GO build slice for the AEF Workflow Designer (T-002 GO). The T-002 scope
fence names "Establish verification (schema validation of produced workflow
files)" as IN scope (`docs/reports/T-002-aef-workflow-designer-goals.md:99`).
The runtime executor (`fw workflow run`) is explicitly OUT of scope (line 102) —
this validator checks structure only, it does **not** execute workflows.

The rule set is the contract in `docs/designer/schema.md` §7.3 (validity rules)
plus the required-field tables in §3 (top-level), §4.1 (nodes), §5 (lanes),
§6.1 (edges). The validator operates on the **YAML canonical form** (§3), which
is the AEF-canonical, source-controlled, hand-authorable representation and the
producer↔executor contract. BPMN-XML validation is a possible later slice
(noted, not in this task).

Deliverable: a standalone, dependency-light validator (`tools/validate-workflow.py`)
with an audit-style exit-code contract, human + `--json` output, golden/invalid
fixtures, and a test that proves each rule fires. Standalone (not wired into the
vendored `fw` CLI) to respect the product/framework boundary and Directive 4
(Portability) — the framework can later adopt it as `fw workflow validate`.

## Acceptance Criteria

### Agent
<!-- Criteria the agent can verify (code, tests, commands). P-010 gates on these. -->
- [x] `tools/validate-workflow.py` exists and validates a YAML workflow file, exiting 0 (valid), 1 (warnings only), 2 (errors), matching the AEF audit convention
- [x] Hard rules (ERROR, exit 2) enforced: missing top-level `workflowMeta`/`pool`/`lanes`/`nodes`/`edges`; missing required node fields (`uid`,`type`,`name`,`lane`,`x`,`y`); missing required lane fields (`id`,`name`,`authority`,`height`); missing required edge fields (`uid`,`source`,`target`); unknown node `type`; `authority` outside the §5 enum; duplicate `uid` across nodes+edges; edge `source`/`target` not resolving to a node `uid`; node `lane` not matching a lane `id`; non-unique lane `abbr` (§2); `exclusiveGateway` with fewer than 2 outgoing edges (§7.3)
- [x] Convention rules (WARN, exit 1) emitted, not fatal: `exclusiveGateway` where more than one outgoing edge lacks a `condition` and none is default-marked (ambiguous routing, §6.5); a required `io.input` on a node with no upstream-reachable node emitting a matching-name output (§4.3/§7.3, name-based heuristic since the type vocabulary is extensible)
- [x] Each finding reports severity + rule id + location (`uid`/`id`) + message; `--json` emits machine-readable findings for the executor contract
- [x] Golden fixture `tests/fixtures/valid/investigate.workflow.yaml` (derived from schema.md §3) validates clean (exit 0); one invalid fixture per hard rule under `tests/fixtures/invalid/` each triggers its specific rule
- [x] `tests/run-validator-tests.sh` asserts the exit code + expected rule id for every fixture and exits 0 when all pass

### Human
<!-- All criteria are agent-verifiable (deterministic exit codes + rule ids). No Human ACs. -->

## Verification

# Shell commands that MUST pass before work-completed. One per line.
# Lines starting with # are comments (skipped). Empty lines ignored.
# The completion gate runs each command — if any exits non-zero, completion is blocked.
#
# Toolchain hint (L-291): if you edited *.vbproj/*.csproj/*.xaml add `dotnet build`;
# *.go → `go build ./...`; Cargo.toml → `cargo check`; tsconfig.json → `tsc --noEmit`;
# pom.xml → `mvn -q compile`. P-011 runs only what you write — broken builds slip
# past otherwise (origin: 003-NTB-ATC-Plugin T-077, broken WPF DLL on master 5 days).
#
# Pipefail/SIGPIPE hint (L-387): P-011 runs each command under `set -eo pipefail`.
# `cmd | grep -q PATTERN` exits 141 (SIGPIPE) when grep matches and closes stdin
# while the upstream is still writing — verification then "fails" even though
# the pattern was present. Safe pattern: capture first, grep the capture:
#     out=$(cmd 2>&1); echo "$out" | grep -q "PATTERN"
# Or:
#     cmd > /tmp/.out 2>&1 && grep -q "PATTERN" /tmp/.out
# Origin: L-387, captured 4× (T-1716, T-1838, T-1862, T-1863) before this hint.
#
# Single pipe only — no intermediate tail/awk/sed stages between capture and grep
# (T-2090): `echo "$out" | tail -3 | grep -q PAT` re-introduces the SIGPIPE risk
# the capture step closed off — the middle stage is what `grep -q` slams its
# stdin on. `echo "$out"` is small and immediate; grep scans the whole captured
# string anyway, so the tail-3 was cosmetic. Drop it: `echo "$out" | grep -q PAT`.
#
# Enforcement-baseline hint (L-398, T-1886): if you edited `.claude/settings.json`
# (added/removed/reorganised hooks), add `bin/fw enforcement baseline` to your
# Verification block. Otherwise the canonical hash diverges and `fw doctor`
# reports a FAIL ("Enforcement baseline CHANGED") that accumulates silently.
# Origin: T-1849/T-1730/T-1731 each added a legitimate hook without refreshing
# the baseline — FAIL sat for multiple sessions until T-1886 cleaned up.

# Validator is syntactically parseable
python3 -c "import ast; ast.parse(open('tools/validate-workflow.py').read())"
# Golden fixture validates clean (exit 0)
python3 tools/validate-workflow.py tests/fixtures/valid/investigate.workflow.yaml
# Full fixture suite: every invalid fixture fires its expected rule, golden passes
bash tests/run-validator-tests.sh

## RCA

<!-- REQUIRED for bug-class tasks (workflow_type=build with bug-tag, OR title matches
     fix/bug/rca/broken/crash/error/regression/fail/hotfix).
     Non-bug-class tasks may leave this section empty or remove it.

     For bug-class, fill in:
       **Symptom:** what was observed (the user-facing manifestation).
       **Root cause:** the specific structural/logical gap — not "the code was wrong".
       **Why structurally allowed:** what in the framework/code/tooling let this go undetected.
       **Prevention:** what catches the next instance (test/lint/gate/doc/learning) — distinct from the fix itself.

     The completion gate (T-1550, G-019) blocks --status work-completed when
     bug-class AND this section is empty/template-only. Use --skip-rca to bypass (logged).
-->

## Evolution

<!-- REQUIRED for arc-tagged build tasks (tags include arc:*). Captures how
     understanding evolved during build — what was learned that wasn't known at
     filing, what in the original plan no longer fits, what triggered pivots
     or new sub-tasks. Mandatory at slice boundaries (when applicable) and
     before --status work-completed.

     Origin: T-1717 grill Q4 — "the understanding of what we need and want
     evolves with the process of materialisation." Structural counter to §ACD:
     spec-vs-build divergence is logged as soon as it happens, not lost as
     folklore.

     Format (one entry per slice boundary or significant insight):
       ### YYYY-MM-DD — [topic]
       - **What changed:** [what we learned that we didn't know at filing]
       - **Plan impact:** [what in the plan no longer fits]
       - **Triggered:** [new sub-task / pivot / scope cut, with task ID if filed]

     The completion gate (T-1718) blocks --status work-completed when this
     section exists but is empty/template-only. Use --skip-evolution to bypass
     (logged Tier-2). Non-arc tasks may leave this empty.
-->

## Decisions

<!-- Record decisions ONLY when choosing between alternatives.
     Skip for tasks with no meaningful choices.
     Format:
     ### [date] — [topic]
     - **Chose:** [what was decided]
     - **Why:** [rationale]
     - **Rejected:** [alternatives and why not]
-->

## Decision

<!-- Filled at completion of inception tasks via:
     fw inception decide T-XXX go|no-go|defer --rationale "..."

     For non-inception tasks this section is ignored. Kept in template
     so `fw inception decide` (lib/inception.sh) finds the anchor heading
     without auto-creating; T-1832 added auto-create as fallback for
     legacy tasks lacking this section. -->
