  Found by the be.26 upgrade's browser tier (T-1373): 2 of 135 browser legs red. _t358
  byte identity: kitchen-sink drifts since 0.36.0 (T-1366 id words, T-1369 grown lanes;
  intended). _t1096: expects the pre-T-1372 notice wording. Both changes were pushed
  and released after only the core tier; the release job runs only core.

# T-1374: Browser tier red since 0.36.0: kitchen-sink golden not re-recorded after T-1366/T-1369, T-1096 notice leg not updated after T-1372 — and the release pushed past it

## Context

<!-- All four parts are required before source edits (T-4907). Plain language; link design docs for substantial tasks. -->
**Background / trigger:** The be.26 upgrade (T-1373) ran both tiers, as an upgrade must. Core was green (220/0); the
browser tier was RED, 133 passed and 2 failed:
- `_t358-byteid-thirdparty`: kitchen-sink.bpmn drifts from its golden. Run per tag: identical at 0.35.0, drifted at
  0.36.0 and 0.37.0.
- `_t1096-data-objects-roundtrip`: it expects the notice "3 data object/store elements … not shown yet", which T-1372
  replaced.

**Problem / hypothesis:** Neither failure comes from the upgrade. Both are intended changes whose browser-tier
expectations were not updated:
- **T-1366** renamed conditional and signal event ids from `link`, so the remaining link events renumber.
- **T-1369** grows a lane that holds documents, which moves the shapes below it.
- **T-1372** reworded the data notice.
The kitchen-sink diff (102 lines) contains only those: the id words (`lan_link_event_N` → `lan_signal_event_N` /
`lan_conditional_event_N` and the renumbering), a taller lane (`laneMeta height`), and the moved shapes' DI. They were
missed because the agent pushed T-1366, T-1369 and T-1372 after the core tier only, and the release jobs (117, 119) run
only the core tier. Releases 0.36.0 and 0.37.0 therefore shipped with this browser leg red.

**Goal:** The browser tier green again, with the goldens re-recorded deliberately (the harness's rule: commit the
golden diff as the review record) and the T-1096 leg checking the new notice. And a guard so that a release cannot go
out on a red browser tier.

**Expected outcome:** Both tiers green on the be.26 tree. The kitchen-sink golden diff is committed with its reason.
The release job runs the browser tier before it tags.

## Acceptance Criteria

### Agent
<!-- Criteria the agent can verify (code, tests, commands). P-010 gates on these. -->
- [x] `tests/goldens/third-party/kitchen-sink.bpmn.golden` re-recorded with `node tools/_t358-byteid-thirdparty.mjs
  --record`, and committed alone with the diff explained (T-1366 id words, T-1369 lane growth). The other 10 goldens
  are unchanged.
- [x] `tools/_t1096-data-objects-roundtrip-cdp.mjs` checks the new notice: the data store named as "in the file and
  saved back unchanged, but not drawn".
- [x] The browser tier is green on this tree (`tests/run-bridge-tests.sh --tier browser`), and so is the core tier.
- [x] Prevention: `tools/runme-new.sh`'s release template, or the next release job, has a step that runs the browser
  tier before tagging. Until a job is written, it is recorded as a learning and a rule in CLAUDE.md: a change under
  `src/` is pushed only after the browser tier, not only the core tier.

### Human
<!-- Criteria requiring human verification (UI/UX, subjective quality). Not blocking.
     Remove this section if all criteria are agent-verifiable.
     Each criterion MUST include Steps/Expected/If-not so the human can act without guessing.

     ── Prefix routing (T-1811, T-1878): default to [REVIEWER] if Expected is grep-able ──
     If your Expected clause is grep-able / file-exists / structural (a deterministic
     shell check), prefer [REVIEWER] — that AC should be an Agent AC with the reviewer
     command in `## Verification` instead of a Human AC here. Only keep [REVIEW] if
     verification genuinely needs human taste (tone, feel, layout rhythm).
     See CLAUDE.md §AC Classification Guidance for the conversion rule.

     [REVIEW] example (genuine human judgment):
       - [ ] [REVIEW] Dashboard renders correctly
         **Steps:**
         1. Open https://example.com/dashboard in browser
         2. Verify all panels load within 2 seconds
         3. Check browser console for errors
         **Expected:** All panels visible, no console errors
         **If not:** Screenshot the broken panel and note the console error

     [REVIEWER] example (static-scan-verifiable — convert to Agent AC + Verification):
       - [ ] [REVIEWER] Block message names both bypass mechanisms
         **Steps:**
         1. Run `bin/fw reviewer T-1374`
         **Expected:** Verdict: PASS; no findings on `block-message-completeness`
         **If not:** Inspect hook block-message string and add missing mechanism
       Conversion: this AC should be moved to ### Agent and
       `bin/fw reviewer T-1374 2>&1 | grep -q "Overall:.*PASS"` added to ## Verification.

<!--
  Render-touching build tasks (web/templates, web/static, web/blueprints, web/shared.py,
  web/app.py …) add a section headed "Visual Verification" (level-2 heading) after
  Verification, with one checklist table — the check-visual-verification gate reads it
  at commit time (T-4213; T-4202 GO):

    | state | control | 1024 | 1440 | 1920 | note |
    |-------|---------|------|------|------|------|
    | toolbar | Load | ok | ok | ok | |

  Cells: ok / clipped / hidden / overlap / unreachable (non-ok needs a note). Each
  listed state needs screenshots at every UX_SHOT_WIDTHS width:
  fw ux shots <T-ID> <state>=<URL>. This comment is inert: the gate ignores it.
-->

## Verification

<!-- T-4906: guidance is an HTML comment so GitHub does not render its `#` lines as
     headings; the completion gate strips HTML comments before running anything.
     Write your commands BELOW this comment, one per line.
# Shell commands that MUST pass before work-completed. One per line.
# Lines starting with # are comments (skipped). Empty lines ignored.
# The completion gate runs each command — if any exits non-zero, completion is blocked.
# Build/refactor/decommission tasks with NO command here are refused. If nothing can be
# run, add the line `# verification: none — <why nothing can be run>`; it is serviced
# (queued for review: add a check / other evidence / accept). See docs/reports/T-4024-servicing-loop.md.
#
# Toolchain hint (L-291): if you edited *.vbproj/*.csproj/*.xaml add `dotnet build`;
# *.go → `go build ./...`; Cargo.toml → `cargo check`; tsconfig.json → `tsc --noEmit`;
# pom.xml → `mvn -q compile`. P-011 runs only what you write — broken builds slip
# past otherwise (origin: 003-NTB-ATC-Plugin T-077, broken WPF DLL on master 5 days).
#
# ── Mutable-corpus anchor (T-3326) ────────────────────────────────────────────
# Do NOT anchor a verification line (or a unit test it runs) to MUTABLE corpus
# state — an exact live count, or a grep of live `fw audit`/`fw doctor` output
# for a specific corpus entity (a named arc, a task count, a census number).
# The corpus moves under the check, and the line rots: it goes red (or vanishes
# its pattern) for reasons unrelated to the code under test, blocking closes.
# Pin the INVARIANT (categories sum, count > 0, property holds) or run the code
# against a COMMITTED FIXTURE — never the live count or a live-audit line.
# Origin: T-2969 line grepping live audit for one arc's status; T-2871's census
# test pinning exact live counts (56→74 files) — both blocked closes (OBS-377).
#
# ── Pipefail/SIGPIPE: grepping a command's output (L-387, T-2090, T-2743, T-2738) ──
#
# THE DEFAULT — redirect to a file, then grep the file:
#     cmd > /tmp/.out 2>&1 && grep -q "PATTERN" /tmp/.out
#     curl -sf "$(bin/fw watchtower url)/page" -o /tmp/.out && grep -q "PAT" /tmp/.out
# Correct at any output size, and `&&` keeps the PRODUCING command's exit code in
# the verdict. Reach for this first; the alternative below is the special case.
#
# Why not `cmd | grep -q PAT` (L-387): P-011 runs each line with PIPEFAIL LIVE
# (errexit is not — see below). When grep matches it exits and closes stdin while cmd is still
# writing, cmd takes SIGPIPE, the pipeline exits 141 — verification "fails" with
# the pattern present. Captured 4× (T-1716, T-1838, T-1862, T-1863).
#
# THE EXCEPTION — capture first, grep the capture with a HERE-STRING:
#     out=$(cmd 2>&1); grep -q "PATTERN" <<<"$out"
# No pipe, so no SIGPIPE at any size. Do NOT write `echo "$out" | grep -q PAT`:
# it is not safe "below 64 KB" as this file used to say (T-4921, 832 T-1340). The
# builtin writes a multi-line value line by line, so grep -q can exit before the
# last write at ANY size (measured 4 in 3,000 for a 40-line value), and above the
# pipe buffer it fails every time (T-2743: 146,366-byte page, 3/3). In a gate that
# allows on "no match" that is a fail-OPEN (T-4920: the Tier 0 pre-filter).
# The capture still discards cmd's exit code, so a 404 yields an empty capture that
# grep merely fails to match rather than a failed line — prefer THE DEFAULT above.
#
# TEST RUNNERS need a guard either way (T-2738). `set -e` is suppressed inside the
# `if` condition the gate runs each line in, so in `cmd1; cmd2` only cmd2 is the
# verdict — and the pass marker you grep for survives a partial failure: a suite
# printing "3 failed, 9 passed" satisfies `grep -q "9 passed"`, and generalising
# to `grep -qE "[0-9]+ passed"` matches the same output. Keep the exit code:
#     python3 -m pytest <file> -q > /tmp/.out 2>&1 && grep -q passed /tmp/.out
# or add the guard the exit code used to supply:
#     out=$(python3 -m pytest <file> -q 2>&1); grep -q passed <<<"$out" && ! grep -q failed <<<"$out"
#     out=$(bats <file> 2>&1); grep -q '^ok 1 ' <<<"$out" && ! grep -q '^not ok' <<<"$out"
# The close gate refuses the unguarded form. Bypass: FW_ALLOW_UNJUDGED_TEST_RUN=1.
#
# ── A SKIPPED BATS TEST REPORTS `ok` (T-3217) ─────────────────────────────────
#
# `! grep -q "^not ok"` does NOT mean the suite ran. Bats emits a skip as
#     ok 6 <name> # skip <reason>
# which is not a `not ok`, so the gate passes and the report says ok while the
# thing the test covers was measured NOWHERE. Origin: T-3213 guarded a test with
# `[ "$(id -u)" -eq 0 ] && skip` — the suite runs as root here and in CI, so it
# skipped on every run that mattered, for as long as it existed.
#
# Add a skip clause to any bats verification line. `# skip` is the marker bats
# writes; counting it is the whole check:
#     timeout 300 bats <file> > /tmp/.out 2>&1 && ! grep -q "^not ok" /tmp/.out
#     test "$(grep -c '# skip' /tmp/.out)" -eq 0
# Two lines, because they answer different questions — "did anything fail" and
# "did everything run". If some skips are legitimate on your host (an optional
# dependency is genuinely absent), assert the COUNT you expect rather than zero,
# and say in the task why that number is right.
#
# Corpus-wide, the same check runs from `bin/fw test lint`
# (tools/bats-silent-skip-lint.py): static mode flags guards that are fixed for
# a deployment rather than probing an optional dependency, and `--tap FILE`
# reports the skips a real run actually fired.
#
# REHEARSING A LINE BY HAND DOES NOT REHEARSE THE GATE (T-2743). Your interactive
# shell has no pipefail. A line has returned 0 by hand and 141 under P-011, from
# the same directory, the same second. To rehearse for real:
#     bash -c 'set -o pipefail; <your verification line>'
#
# NOTE THE MISSING `-e` — it is not a typo (T-3203). This file used to prescribe
# `set -eo pipefail` here, which is NOT the gate: it adds errexit the gate does
# not have, so it FAILS lines the gate PASSES. Measured, 10 lines, 3 diverged:
#     line                            gate    set -eo (old)   set -o (this)
#     false; true                     PASS    FAIL  wrong     PASS  ok
#     cd /nonexistent; echo ok        PASS    FAIL  wrong     PASS  ok
#     grep -q MISS file; true         PASS    FAIL  wrong     PASS  ok
# The divergence is one-directional and that is the trap: the old rehearsal only
# ever fails lines the gate accepts, so it produces false REDS, and an author
# who "fixes" a line to satisfy it is fixing something that was never broken —
# while the line that actually is broken (`cmd1; cmd2` where cmd1 fails) passes
# both. Re-derive rather than trust this table — it is pinned, not asserted:
#     bats tests/unit/t3203_p011_gate_semantics.bats
#
# ── `cmd1; cmd2` IS JUDGED ONLY ON cmd2 (T-3203) ──────────────────────────────
#
# The gate runs each line as the CONDITION of an `if` (update-task.sh:1215), and
# POSIX suppresses errexit for a compound command in an `if` condition — through
# the subshell. So pipefail applies and `set -e` does not, and in a sequence only
# the LAST command's status reaches the verdict. `cd /nonexistent; echo ok` passes.
# 2,644 of 10,997 verification lines in this corpus contain `;` (re-derive with
# the query in docs/reports/T-3203-p011-gate-semantics.md).
#
# SAFE SHAPES — both verified biting, each against a passing control:
#   A. one command whose own status is the verdict (prefer this):
#        out=$(cmd 2>&1); echo "$out" | grep -q PAT && ! echo "$out" | grep -q BAD
#      the leading assignments are setup; the trailing `&&` chain is the verdict.
#   B. an explicit sub-shell, whose errexit the outer `if` cannot reach into:
#        bash -c 'set -eo pipefail; cmd1; cmd2'
#      use when you genuinely need every command in the sequence to count.
#
# The rule of thumb: put the assertion LAST, and make sure it is an assertion.
#
# Enforcement-baseline hint (L-398, T-1886): if you edited `.claude/settings.json`
# (added/removed/reorganised hooks), add `bin/fw enforcement baseline` to your
# Verification block. Otherwise the canonical hash diverges and `fw doctor`
# reports a FAIL ("Enforcement baseline CHANGED") that accumulates silently.
# Origin: T-1849/T-1730/T-1731 each added a legitimate hook without refreshing
# the baseline — FAIL sat for multiple sessions until T-1886 cleaned up.
#
# Vendored-path hint (T-3236, T-4419): if you edited bin/fw, lib/, agents/, policy/,
# web/, tools/ or .tasks/templates/, run `bin/fw vendor self` and add
#     bin/fw vendor self --check --task T-1374X
# (your own task id). It checks only the files your commits changed, so another
# worker's uncommitted edit does not block your close; that drift is listed as
# "in flight, not this task". The whole-tree `--check` stays for audit/pre-push.

## RCA

<!-- REQUIRED for bug-class tasks (workflow_type=build with bug-tag, OR title matches
     fix/bug/rca/broken/crash/error/regression/fail/hotfix).
     Non-bug-class tasks may leave this section empty or remove it.

     For bug-class, fill in:
       **Symptom:** what was observed (the user-facing manifestation).
       **Root cause:** the specific structural/logical gap — not "the code was wrong".
       **Why structurally allowed:** what in the framework/code/tooling let this go undetected.
       **Prevention:** what catches the next instance (test/lint/gate/doc/learning) — distinct from the fix itself.

     The completion gate (T-1550, G-019) blocks --status work-completed when
     bug-class AND this section is empty/template-only. Use --skip-rca to bypass (logged).
-->

**Symptom:** after the be.26 upgrade the browser tier was red on two legs: the kitchen-sink byte-identity golden
(T-358) and the T-1096 data-objects notice leg. Both had been red since 0.36.0, and 0.36.0 and 0.37.0 shipped that way.

**Root cause:** T-1366 (plain-event kind words in ids) and T-1369 (lanes grow to fit drawn documents) intentionally
changed the bytes saved for kitchen-sink, and T-1372 rewrote the import notice. The golden was not re-recorded and
the T-1096 regex not updated, because neither leg ran before those changes were pushed.

**Why structurally allowed:** the pre-push hook runs only the core tier. The goldens and CDP harnesses live in the
browser tier, which nothing required before a push or a release tag. The release jobs (117, 119) had no browser step.

**Prevention:** CLAUDE.md rule (4d5d1ded1): a change under `src/` is pushed only after the browser tier too, an
intended byte change is re-recorded deliberately and committed alone, and a release job runs the browser tier before
it tags. The session-start alerts print the last browser run ("Browser tier: OK … at <sha>"), so a stale one shows.

## Evolution

     or new sub-tasks. Mandatory at slice boundaries (when applicable) and
     before --status work-completed.

     Origin: T-1717 grill Q4 — "the understanding of what we need and want
     evolves with the process of materialisation." Structural counter to §ACD:
     spec-vs-build divergence is logged as soon as it happens, not lost as
     folklore.

     Format (one entry per slice boundary or significant insight):
       ### YYYY-MM-DD — [topic]
       - **What changed:** [what we learned that we didn't know at filing]
       - **Plan impact:** [what in the plan no longer fits]
       - **Triggered:** [new sub-task / pivot / scope cut, with task ID if filed]

     The completion gate (T-1718) blocks --status work-completed when this
     section exists but is empty/template-only. Use --skip-evolution to bypass
     (logged Tier-2). Non-arc tasks may leave this empty.

## Recommendation

<!-- T-2945: same shape as inception.md's block — the gate that reads it
     (audit_inception_recommendation, lib/task-audit.sh:117) is shared, so the
     shape is copied rather than reinvented.

     REQUIRED once this task reaches partial-complete: Agent ACs done, at least
     one `### Human` AC still unticked. `lib/review.sh:205-211` (T-2421) BLOCKS
     `fw task review` emission for build/refactor/test/decommission tasks in that
     state with no substantive block here — the operator would otherwise open
     /review/<id> to a blank Recommendation card and be asked to approve a form.

     Not required while every Human AC is ticked or the task has none: the gate
     only fires on the partial-complete transition. It is here from the start so
     you write it while you still have the evidence, not when the gate refuses.

     Format (the parser wants the `**Recommendation:**` line at the start of a
     line; a leading `-` or `*` bullet is also accepted):
     **Recommendation:** GO / NO-GO / DEFER
     **Rationale:** Why (cite evidence — what shipped, what was proven, what remains)
     **Evidence:**
     - Finding 1
     - Finding 2

     DEFER is for evidence gaps, not confidence gaps (CLAUDE.md §Presenting Work
     for Human Review). If the artefact is complete and you still don't want to
     commit, that is a calibration failure — recommend GO or NO-GO.

## Decisions

<!-- Record decisions ONLY when choosing between alternatives.
     Skip for tasks with no meaningful choices.
     Format:
     ### [date] — [topic]
     - **Chose:** [what was decided]
     - **Why:** [rationale]
     - **Rejected:** [alternatives and why not]
-->

## Decision

<!-- Filled at completion of inception tasks via:
     fw inception decide T-1374 go|no-go|defer --rationale "..."

     For non-inception tasks this section is ignored. Kept in template
     so `fw inception decide` (lib/inception.sh) finds the anchor heading
     without auto-creating; T-1832 added auto-create as fallback for
     legacy tasks lacking this section. -->

## Reviewer Verdict (v1.5)

- **Scan ID:** R-adde0c30
- **Timestamp:** 2026-11-02T21:52:21Z
- **Catalogue:** v1.3-seed
- **Overall:** CONCERN
- **Scope:** static anti-pattern scan; PASS means no anti-pattern was found, not that the criteria hold
- **Needs Human:** no
- **Findings:** 4

**Per-AC findings:**

- **AC#1 (Agent)** — `tests/goldens/third-party/kitchen-sink.bpmn.golden` re-recorded with `node tools/_t358-byteid-thirdparty.mjs
  - **AC-verify-mismatch** (narrow, heuristic) — `path=tests/goldens/third-party/kitchen-sink.bpmn in: `tests/goldens/third-party/kitchen-sink.bpmn.golden` re-recorded with `node tools/_t358-byteid-thirdparty.mjs`
- **AC#3 (Agent)** — The browser tier is green on this tree (`tests/run-bridge-tests.sh --tier browser`), and so is the core tier.
  - **AC-verify-mismatch** (narrow, heuristic) — `path=tests/run-bridge-tests.sh in: The browser tier is green on this tree (`tests/run-bridge-tests.sh --tier browser`), and so is the core tier.`
- **AC#4 (Agent)** — Prevention: `tools/runme-new.sh`'s release template, or the next release job, has a step that runs the browser
  - **AC-verify-mismatch** (narrow, heuristic) — `path=tools/runme-new.sh in: Prevention: `tools/runme-new.sh`'s release template, or the next release job, has a step that runs the browser`

**Verification-level findings:**

  1. **l387-sigpipe-risk** (partial, heuristic) @ Verification:line 139
     - evidence: `git log --format=%s -1 7305d269c | grep -q 'kitchen-sink golden'`
