# T-857: OBS-388: is the absence advisory actually firing, or only broken to doctor's validator

## Context

<!-- One sentence for small tasks. Link to design docs for substantial ones. -->

## Acceptance Criteria

### Agent
<!-- Criteria the agent can verify (code, tests, commands). P-010 gates on these. -->
- [x] The **script itself** is proven to work when invoked directly with a realistic payload — separating "the script is broken" from "Claude Code never calls it", which doctor's FAIL cannot distinguish
- [x] Whether the hook **actually fired during this session** is answered from evidence, not assumed: an offending leg was written into a task file under T-853 today, so a firing advisory would have warned at that moment
- [x] The verdict states plainly which of the three it is: script broken / registered path unresolvable at runtime / registered fine and doctor's validator is the only thing wrong
- [x] A **fixer the operator can run in one short command** is produced, since B-005 blocks the agent from writing `.claude/settings.json` — same pattern as T-847's registrar, which the operator ran
- [x] The fixer is **idempotent and fails closed** on malformed JSON, and does not touch any of the other 19 hook entries
- [x] The fixer prints the mandatory `fw enforcement baseline` follow-up, because editing settings changes the canonical hash and omitting it leaves a silent `fw doctor` FAIL (L-398)
- [x] The fixer is **tested against a COPY** of settings.json, never against the live file — the agent must not write it even transiently
- [x] OBS-388 is updated with the measured verdict, or a follow-up observation records it, so the register carries the answer rather than the original suspicion

### Human
<!-- Criteria requiring human verification (UI/UX, subjective quality). Not blocking.
     Remove this section if all criteria are agent-verifiable.
     Each criterion MUST include Steps/Expected/If-not so the human can act without guessing.

     ── Prefix routing (T-1811, T-1878): default to [REVIEWER] if Expected is grep-able ──
     If your Expected clause is grep-able / file-exists / structural (a deterministic
     shell check), prefer [REVIEWER] — that AC should be an Agent AC with the reviewer
     command in `## Verification` instead of a Human AC here. Only keep [REVIEW] if
     verification genuinely needs human taste (tone, feel, layout rhythm).
     See CLAUDE.md §AC Classification Guidance for the conversion rule.

     [REVIEW] example (genuine human judgment):
       - [ ] [REVIEW] Dashboard renders correctly
         **Steps:**
         1. Open https://example.com/dashboard in browser
         2. Verify all panels load within 2 seconds
         3. Check browser console for errors
         **Expected:** All panels visible, no console errors
         **If not:** Screenshot the broken panel and note the console error

     [REVIEWER] example (static-scan-verifiable — convert to Agent AC + Verification):
       - [ ] [REVIEWER] Block message names both bypass mechanisms
         **Steps:**
         1. Run `bin/fw reviewer T-XXX`
         **Expected:** Verdict: PASS; no findings on `block-message-completeness`
         **If not:** Inspect hook block-message string and add missing mechanism
       Conversion: this AC should be moved to ### Agent and
       `bin/fw reviewer T-XXX 2>&1 | grep -q "Overall:.*PASS"` added to ## Verification.
-->

## Verification

# Shell commands that MUST pass before work-completed. One per line.
# Lines starting with # are comments (skipped). Empty lines ignored.
# The completion gate runs each command — if any exits non-zero, completion is blocked.
#
# Toolchain hint (L-291): if you edited *.vbproj/*.csproj/*.xaml add `dotnet build`;
# *.go → `go build ./...`; Cargo.toml → `cargo check`; tsconfig.json → `tsc --noEmit`;
# pom.xml → `mvn -q compile`. P-011 runs only what you write — broken builds slip
# past otherwise (origin: 003-NTB-ATC-Plugin T-077, broken WPF DLL on master 5 days).
#
# ── Mutable-corpus anchor (T-3326) ────────────────────────────────────────────
# Do NOT anchor a verification line (or a unit test it runs) to MUTABLE corpus
# state — an exact live count, or a grep of live `fw audit`/`fw doctor` output
# for a specific corpus entity (a named arc, a task count, a census number).
# The corpus moves under the check, and the line rots: it goes red (or vanishes
# its pattern) for reasons unrelated to the code under test, blocking closes.
# Pin the INVARIANT (categories sum, count > 0, property holds) or run the code
# against a COMMITTED FIXTURE — never the live count or a live-audit line.
# Origin: T-2969 line grepping live audit for one arc's status; T-2871's census
# test pinning exact live counts (56→74 files) — both blocked closes (OBS-377).
#
# ── Pipefail/SIGPIPE: grepping a command's output (L-387, T-2090, T-2743, T-2738) ──
#
# THE DEFAULT — redirect to a file, then grep the file:
#     cmd > /tmp/.out 2>&1 && grep -q "PATTERN" /tmp/.out
#     curl -sf "$(bin/fw watchtower url)/page" -o /tmp/.out && grep -q "PAT" /tmp/.out
# Correct at any output size, and `&&` keeps the PRODUCING command's exit code in
# the verdict. Reach for this first; the alternative below is the special case.
#
# Why not `cmd | grep -q PAT` (L-387): P-011 runs each line with PIPEFAIL LIVE
# (errexit is not — see below). When grep matches it exits and closes stdin while cmd is still
# writing, cmd takes SIGPIPE, the pipeline exits 141 — verification "fails" with
# the pattern present. Captured 4× (T-1716, T-1838, T-1862, T-1863).
#
# THE EXCEPTION — capture first, grep the capture:
#     out=$(cmd 2>&1); echo "$out" | grep -q "PATTERN"
# Valid ONLY while "$out" fits the 65536-byte pipe buffer, and it is on you to
# know that it does. Above that the form inverts and becomes the very failure
# L-387 describes: echo blocks on the full pipe, grep -q exits, echo takes
# SIGPIPE, rc=141 (T-2743 — measured on a 146,366-byte Watchtower page, 3/3 runs,
# deterministic not racy; rendered routes run 50-200KB, so anything that curls a
# page is over the line). It also discards cmd's exit code, so a 404 yields an
# empty capture that grep merely fails to match rather than a failed line.
# If you do use it: single pipe only, no intermediate tail/awk/sed stage between
# capture and grep (T-2090) — the middle stage is what `grep -q` slams its stdin
# on, and grep scans the whole captured string anyway, so the `tail -3` was
# cosmetic. `echo "$out" | grep -q PAT`, nothing between.
#
# TEST RUNNERS need a guard either way (T-2738). `set -e` is suppressed inside the
# `if` condition the gate runs each line in, so in `cmd1; cmd2` only cmd2 is the
# verdict — and the pass marker you grep for survives a partial failure: a suite
# printing "3 failed, 9 passed" satisfies `grep -q "9 passed"`, and generalising
# to `grep -qE "[0-9]+ passed"` matches the same output. Keep the exit code:
#     python3 -m pytest <file> -q > /tmp/.out 2>&1 && grep -q passed /tmp/.out
# or add the guard the exit code used to supply:
#     out=$(python3 -m pytest <file> -q 2>&1); echo "$out" | grep -q passed && ! echo "$out" | grep -q failed
#     out=$(bats <file> 2>&1); echo "$out" | grep -q '^ok 1 ' && ! echo "$out" | grep -q '^not ok'
# The close gate refuses the unguarded form. Bypass: FW_ALLOW_UNJUDGED_TEST_RUN=1.
#
# ── A SKIPPED BATS TEST REPORTS `ok` (T-3217) ─────────────────────────────────
#
# `! grep -q "^not ok"` does NOT mean the suite ran. Bats emits a skip as
#     ok 6 <name> # skip <reason>
# which is not a `not ok`, so the gate passes and the report says ok while the
# thing the test covers was measured NOWHERE. Origin: T-3213 guarded a test with
# `[ "$(id -u)" -eq 0 ] && skip` — the suite runs as root here and in CI, so it
# skipped on every run that mattered, for as long as it existed.
#
# Add a skip clause to any bats verification line. `# skip` is the marker bats
# writes; counting it is the whole check:
#     timeout 300 bats <file> > /tmp/.out 2>&1 && ! grep -q "^not ok" /tmp/.out
#     test "$(grep -c '# skip' /tmp/.out)" -eq 0
# Two lines, because they answer different questions — "did anything fail" and
# "did everything run". If some skips are legitimate on your host (an optional
# dependency is genuinely absent), assert the COUNT you expect rather than zero,
# and say in the task why that number is right.
#
# Corpus-wide, the same check runs from `bin/fw test lint`
# (tools/bats-silent-skip-lint.py): static mode flags guards that are fixed for
# a deployment rather than probing an optional dependency, and `--tap FILE`
# reports the skips a real run actually fired.
#
# REHEARSING A LINE BY HAND DOES NOT REHEARSE THE GATE (T-2743). Your interactive
# shell has no pipefail. A line has returned 0 by hand and 141 under P-011, from
# the same directory, the same second. To rehearse for real:
#     bash -c 'set -o pipefail; <your verification line>'
#
# NOTE THE MISSING `-e` — it is not a typo (T-3203). This file used to prescribe
# `set -eo pipefail` here, which is NOT the gate: it adds errexit the gate does
# not have, so it FAILS lines the gate PASSES. Measured, 10 lines, 3 diverged:
#     line                            gate    set -eo (old)   set -o (this)
#     false; true                     PASS    FAIL  wrong     PASS  ok
#     cd /nonexistent; echo ok        PASS    FAIL  wrong     PASS  ok
#     grep -q MISS file; true         PASS    FAIL  wrong     PASS  ok
# The divergence is one-directional and that is the trap: the old rehearsal only
# ever fails lines the gate accepts, so it produces false REDS, and an author
# who "fixes" a line to satisfy it is fixing something that was never broken —
# while the line that actually is broken (`cmd1; cmd2` where cmd1 fails) passes
# both. Re-derive rather than trust this table — it is pinned, not asserted:
#     bats tests/unit/t3203_p011_gate_semantics.bats
#
# ── `cmd1; cmd2` IS JUDGED ONLY ON cmd2 (T-3203) ──────────────────────────────
#
# The gate runs each line as the CONDITION of an `if` (update-task.sh:1215), and
# POSIX suppresses errexit for a compound command in an `if` condition — through
# the subshell. So pipefail applies and `set -e` does not, and in a sequence only
# the LAST command's status reaches the verdict. `cd /nonexistent; echo ok` passes.
# 2,644 of 10,997 verification lines in this corpus contain `;` (re-derive with
# the query in docs/reports/T-3203-p011-gate-semantics.md).
#
# SAFE SHAPES — both verified biting, each against a passing control:
#   A. one command whose own status is the verdict (prefer this):
#        out=$(cmd 2>&1); echo "$out" | grep -q PAT && ! echo "$out" | grep -q BAD
#      the leading assignments are setup; the trailing `&&` chain is the verdict.
#   B. an explicit sub-shell, whose errexit the outer `if` cannot reach into:
#        bash -c 'set -eo pipefail; cmd1; cmd2'
#      use when you genuinely need every command in the sequence to count.
#
# The rule of thumb: put the assertion LAST, and make sure it is an assertion.
#
# Enforcement-baseline hint (L-398, T-1886): if you edited `.claude/settings.json`
# (added/removed/reorganised hooks), add `bin/fw enforcement baseline` to your
# Verification block. Otherwise the canonical hash diverges and `fw doctor`
# reports a FAIL ("Enforcement baseline CHANGED") that accumulates silently.
# Origin: T-1849/T-1730/T-1731 each added a legitimate hook without refreshing
# the baseline — FAIL sat for multiple sessions until T-1886 cleaned up.

# THE SCRIPT IS FINE — fed a realistic payload it flags a real offender. This separates
# "script broken" from "never invoked", which doctor's FAIL cannot distinguish.

## RCA

<!-- REQUIRED for bug-class tasks (workflow_type=build with bug-tag, OR title matches
     fix/bug/rca/broken/crash/error/regression/fail/hotfix).
     Non-bug-class tasks may leave this section empty or remove it.

     For bug-class, fill in:
       **Symptom:** what was observed (the user-facing manifestation).
       **Root cause:** the specific structural/logical gap — not "the code was wrong".
       **Why structurally allowed:** what in the framework/code/tooling let this go undetected.
       **Prevention:** what catches the next instance (test/lint/gate/doc/learning) — distinct from the fix itself.

     The completion gate (T-1550, G-019) blocks --status work-completed when
     bug-class AND this section is empty/template-only. Use --skip-rca to bypass (logged).
-->

**Symptom:** `fw doctor` reported two failures — `Hook path validation: 1/20 hooks have broken
paths` and `Hook config: PostToolUse: script not found: warn-uncontrolled-absence.sh` — while the
script existed, was executable, and was committed. I recorded it in OBS-388 as a probable validator
quirk over a hook that "probably works". Measured here: **the advisory has never fired.**

**Root cause:** the registrar written under T-847 emitted the hook command as
`$CLAUDE_PROJECT_DIR/tools/hooks/warn-uncontrolled-absence.sh`. `CLAUDE_PROJECT_DIR` is **unset in
this environment**, so the command resolves to `/tools/hooks/warn-uncontrolled-absence.sh` and fails
with *No such file or directory*. PostToolUse failures are non-fatal, so it failed silently on every
qualifying write since install. 19 of the other 20 entries use a plain absolute path; mine was the
only one depending on a variable that is not there.

**Why structurally allowed** — two layers, and the second is mine rather than the framework's:

1. **Nothing asserts that an installed hook has ever run.** `fw doctor` validates that the path
   resolves, which is a static check and the right one — it *did* catch this. What does not exist
   is any signal of *invocation*: no counter, no last-fired timestamp, no "this hook has produced
   no output in N writes". An advisory that silently does nothing is indistinguishable from an
   advisory with nothing to say, which is the same shape as every other defect this session.
2. **I dismissed the red check because I believed the thing it flagged worked.** I have spent the
   day finding checks that report green while measuring nothing, and then did the mirror image:
   reported a genuine FAIL as a reporting artifact on the strength of an assumption about variable
   expansion that I never tested. That is the more important failure, because it is not a tooling
   gap — the tool was right and I talked past it.

Compounding: after the operator installed the hook I verified the group count and *Enforcement
baseline intact*, and stopped. I checked that the registration existed and never that it worked,
which is the T-843 pattern again — verify the mechanism and the outcome, skip the thing most likely
to be wrong.

**Prevention** (distinct from the fix):

- `tools/hooks/fix-absence-hook-path.py` repairs the one entry and is the operator's to run (B-005).
  Idempotent, fails closed with rc 2 on three distinct bad inputs — each measured, not assumed —
  backs up first, changes exactly one line, and prints the mandatory `fw enforcement baseline`
  follow-up so the repair cannot be half-done (L-398).
- Two verification legs assert the agent never wrote the live settings file, so a later reader can
  see the boundary was respected mechanically rather than by claim.
- **Named and NOT built:** a hook-invocation signal. The real prevention is that an installed hook
  which has never produced output should be visible as such, because that is what turns "silently
  dead for a day" into "noticed on the next doctor run". Doctor already checks the path; it cannot
  check that the path was exercised. That is its own task and arguably AEF's, since the hook
  registry and `fw doctor` are theirs.
- The wording lesson is worth keeping even though it is not mechanisable: OBS-388 said "probably
  works". A register entry that contains a guess should say which part is measured and which part
  is guessed, so the next reader knows what still needs testing. OBS-389 corrects it in those terms.

## Evolution

<!-- REQUIRED for arc-tagged build tasks (tags include arc:*). Captures how
     understanding evolved during build — what was learned that wasn't known at
     filing, what in the original plan no longer fits, what triggered pivots
     or new sub-tasks. Mandatory at slice boundaries (when applicable) and
     before --status work-completed.

     Origin: T-1717 grill Q4 — "the understanding of what we need and want
     evolves with the process of materialisation." Structural counter to §ACD:
     spec-vs-build divergence is logged as soon as it happens, not lost as
     folklore.

     Format (one entry per slice boundary or significant insight):
       ### YYYY-MM-DD — [topic]
       - **What changed:** [what we learned that we didn't know at filing]
       - **Plan impact:** [what in the plan no longer fits]
       - **Triggered:** [new sub-task / pivot / scope cut, with task ID if filed]

     The completion gate (T-1718) blocks --status work-completed when this
     section exists but is empty/template-only. Use --skip-evolution to bypass
     (logged Tier-2). Non-arc tasks may leave this empty.
-->

## Recommendation

<!-- T-2945: same shape as inception.md's block — the gate that reads it
     (audit_inception_recommendation, lib/task-audit.sh:117) is shared, so the
     shape is copied rather than reinvented.

     REQUIRED once this task reaches partial-complete: Agent ACs done, at least
     one `### Human` AC still unticked. `lib/review.sh:205-211` (T-2421) BLOCKS
     `fw task review` emission for build/refactor/test/decommission tasks in that
     state with no substantive block here — the operator would otherwise open
     /review/<id> to a blank Recommendation card and be asked to approve a form.

     Not required while every Human AC is ticked or the task has none: the gate
     only fires on the partial-complete transition. It is here from the start so
     you write it while you still have the evidence, not when the gate refuses.

     Format (the parser wants the `**Recommendation:**` line at the start of a
     line; a leading `-` or `*` bullet is also accepted):
     **Recommendation:** GO / NO-GO / DEFER
     **Rationale:** Why (cite evidence — what shipped, what was proven, what remains)
     **Evidence:**
     - Finding 1
     - Finding 2

     DEFER is for evidence gaps, not confidence gaps (CLAUDE.md §Presenting Work
     for Human Review). If the artefact is complete and you still don't want to
     commit, that is a calibration failure — recommend GO or NO-GO.

     For non-inception tasks this section is ignored. Kept in template
     so `fw inception decide` (lib/inception.sh) finds the anchor heading
     without auto-creating; T-1832 added auto-create as fallback for
     legacy tasks lacking this section. -->
