# T-070: Routing controls v1 — centre-anchor attachment default (operator R-4)

## Context

Operator ask from T-041 gallery dogfooding: routing behaviour must be controllable, first
setting = arrow ends anchor to the middle of the target object by default (survey finding
R-4 in docs/reports/T-041-routing-readability-survey.md). Centre-anchor: an unpinned edge
end aims at the node's centre; the arrowhead is drawn at the exact node-boundary
intersection, gliding smoothly as nodes move. Explicit port pins (drag onto a port dot)
remain as overrides. Editor-local preference (localStorage) — deliberately NOT part of the
document format, so no bridge/seam-guard surface is touched.

## Acceptance Criteria

### Agent
- [x] `routingPrefs.attach` global preference (`middle` default | `spread`), persisted in localStorage, exposed as a "Routing" control in the left sidebar (toggled live via setRoutingAttach in Playwright)
- [x] In middle mode, unpinned (`auto`) edge ends snap to the mid-point of the facing side for all shape classes (rect mid-edge, circle cardinal point, diamond tip) and sibling edges converge (spread suppressed); spread mode keeps the previous fan-out behaviour
- [x] Explicitly pinned ports still honoured in both modes (anchorPoint named-port branch unchanged); dragging an endpoint onto a node body (not a port dot) in middle mode leaves the end unpinned — trusted-drag verified under T-071 (e_01 re-anchored with `targetPort: "auto"`)
- [x] Visual verification: middle/spread element screenshots of task-lifecycle AND audit-process read — fork/join corridor collapses to converging mid-side entries, no overlap regression, lane bands intact
- [x] Inline script passes `node --check`; bridge suite stays 31 passed / 0 failed (no serialization change)

### Human
<!-- Criteria requiring human verification (UI/UX, subjective quality). Not blocking.
     Remove this section if all criteria are agent-verifiable.
     Each criterion MUST include Steps/Expected/If-not so the human can act without guessing.

     ── Prefix routing (T-1811, T-1878): default to [REVIEWER] if Expected is grep-able ──
     If your Expected clause is grep-able / file-exists / structural (a deterministic
     shell check), prefer [REVIEWER] — that AC should be an Agent AC with the reviewer
     command in `## Verification` instead of a Human AC here. Only keep [REVIEW] if
     verification genuinely needs human taste (tone, feel, layout rhythm).
     See CLAUDE.md §AC Classification Guidance for the conversion rule.

     [REVIEW] example (genuine human judgment):
       - [ ] [REVIEW] Dashboard renders correctly
         **Steps:**
         1. Open https://example.com/dashboard in browser
         2. Verify all panels load within 2 seconds
         3. Check browser console for errors
         **Expected:** All panels visible, no console errors
         **If not:** Screenshot the broken panel and note the console error

     [REVIEWER] example (static-scan-verifiable — convert to Agent AC + Verification):
       - [ ] [REVIEWER] Block message names both bypass mechanisms
         **Steps:**
         1. Run `bin/fw reviewer T-XXX`
         **Expected:** Verdict: PASS; no findings on `block-message-completeness`
         **If not:** Inspect hook block-message string and add missing mechanism
       Conversion: this AC should be moved to ### Agent and
       `bin/fw reviewer T-XXX 2>&1 | grep -q "Overall:.*PASS"` added to ## Verification.

## Verification

# Shell commands that MUST pass before work-completed. One per line.
# Lines starting with # are comments (skipped). Empty lines ignored.
# The completion gate runs each command — if any exits non-zero, completion is blocked.
#
# Toolchain hint (L-291): if you edited *.vbproj/*.csproj/*.xaml add `dotnet build`;
# *.go → `go build ./...`; Cargo.toml → `cargo check`; tsconfig.json → `tsc --noEmit`;
# pom.xml → `mvn -q compile`. P-011 runs only what you write — broken builds slip
# past otherwise (origin: 003-NTB-ATC-Plugin T-077, broken WPF DLL on master 5 days).
#
# Pipefail/SIGPIPE hint (L-387): P-011 runs each command under `set -eo pipefail`.
# `cmd | grep -q PATTERN` exits 141 (SIGPIPE) when grep matches and closes stdin
# while the upstream is still writing — verification then "fails" even though
# the pattern was present. Safe pattern: capture first, grep the capture:
#     out=$(cmd 2>&1); echo "$out" | grep -q "PATTERN"
# Or:
#     cmd > /tmp/.out 2>&1 && grep -q "PATTERN" /tmp/.out
# Origin: L-387, captured 4× (T-1716, T-1838, T-1862, T-1863) before this hint.
#
# Single pipe only — no intermediate tail/awk/sed stages between capture and grep
# (T-2090): `echo "$out" | tail -3 | grep -q PAT` re-introduces the SIGPIPE risk
# the capture step closed off — the middle stage is what `grep -q` slams its
# stdin on. `echo "$out"` is small and immediate; grep scans the whole captured
# string anyway, so the tail-3 was cosmetic. Drop it: `echo "$out" | grep -q PAT`.
#
# Enforcement-baseline hint (L-398, T-1886): if you edited `.claude/settings.json`
# (added/removed/reorganised hooks), add `bin/fw enforcement baseline` to your
# Verification block. Otherwise the canonical hash diverges and `fw doctor`
# reports a FAIL ("Enforcement baseline CHANGED") that accumulates silently.
# Origin: T-1849/T-1730/T-1731 each added a legitimate hook without refreshing
# the baseline — FAIL sat for multiple sessions until T-1886 cleaned up.

## RCA

<!-- REQUIRED for bug-class tasks (workflow_type=build with bug-tag, OR title matches
     fix/bug/rca/broken/crash/error/regression/fail/hotfix).
     Non-bug-class tasks may leave this section empty or remove it.

     For bug-class, fill in:
       **Symptom:** what was observed (the user-facing manifestation).
       **Root cause:** the specific structural/logical gap — not "the code was wrong".
       **Why structurally allowed:** what in the framework/code/tooling let this go undetected.
       **Prevention:** what catches the next instance (test/lint/gate/doc/learning) — distinct from the fix itself.

     The completion gate (T-1550, G-019) blocks --status work-completed when
     bug-class AND this section is empty/template-only. Use --skip-rca to bypass (logged).
-->

## Evolution

<!-- REQUIRED for arc-tagged build tasks (tags include arc:*). Captures how
     understanding evolved during build — what was learned that wasn't known at
     filing, what in the original plan no longer fits, what triggered pivots
     or new sub-tasks. Mandatory at slice boundaries (when applicable) and
     before --status work-completed.

     Origin: T-1717 grill Q4 — "the understanding of what we need and want
     evolves with the process of materialisation." Structural counter to §ACD:
     spec-vs-build divergence is logged as soon as it happens, not lost as
     folklore.

     Format (one entry per slice boundary or significant insight):
       ### YYYY-MM-DD — [topic]
       - **What changed:** [what we learned that we didn't know at filing]
       - **Plan impact:** [what in the plan no longer fits]
       - **Triggered:** [new sub-task / pivot / scope cut, with task ID if filed]

     The completion gate (T-1718) blocks --status work-completed when this
     section exists but is empty/template-only. Use --skip-evolution to bypass
     (logged Tier-2). Non-arc tasks may leave this empty.
-->

## Decisions

### 2026-07-04 — Middle-attach semantics: mid-side snap, not centre-aim
- **Chose:** "middle" mode snaps unpinned edge ends to the mid-point of the facing side (rect mid-edge / circle cardinal / diamond tip), with sibling-edge spread suppressed so arrows converge.
- **Why:** Inspection showed `auto` anchoring was ALREADY centre-aim (portPointTowards computes the exact boundary intersection toward the other end) — yet the operator still saw restless corner-ish entries. The actual noise source was the per-edge spread fanning entries along the side plus free-angle boundary points. Mid-side snap is the semantics that delivers the requested calm ("snap arrow end to middle of object"): predictable entry points, converging arrows, classic-BPMN look. Verified visually: audit-process's fork/join wireframe corridor collapses.
- **Rejected:** (a) centre-aim dynamic — already the status quo, demonstrably not calm enough; (b) pinning nearest mid-side port into the document — routing preference is presentation, not document data; keeping it editor-local (localStorage) leaves the bridge seam untouched.

### 2026-07-04 — Preference scope: editor-local, not document vocabulary
- **Chose:** `routingPrefs` lives in localStorage only; the .bpmn/.yaml formats are unchanged.
- **Why:** Zero seam-guard surface (G-002); different operators can prefer different rendering without dirtying shared corpus files.
- **Rejected:** an `aef.routing` document key — would force bridge parity work (6th→7th guard) for a purely visual preference.

## Decision

<!-- Filled at completion of inception tasks via:
     fw inception decide T-XXX go|no-go|defer --rationale "..."

     For non-inception tasks this section is ignored. Kept in template
     so `fw inception decide` (lib/inception.sh) finds the anchor heading
     without auto-creating; T-1832 added auto-create as fallback for
     legacy tasks lacking this section. -->
