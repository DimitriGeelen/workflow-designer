# T-165: Open this version action in the Versions modal

## Context

The Versions modal's only per-version action is **↩ Revert**, which loads that version in
place but reads as a destructive rollback — discouraging users from just pulling up an old
version to look at it. Add a non-scary **⤢ Open** action that loads the selected version into
the editor in place (same mechanism as `revertToVersion` — `/api/version` → `adoptImportedXml`
with `replace:true`, set the loaded-version badge), framed as "view / work from this version".
Keep Revert unchanged. Small, self-contained; no server or data-model change.

## Acceptance Criteria

### Agent
<!-- Criteria the agent can verify (code, tests, commands). P-010 gates on these. -->
- [x] Each Versions-modal row has an **⤢ Open** button alongside **↩ Revert**; clicking Open loads that version's XML into the editor in place, sets the loaded-version badge to vN, closes the modal, and shows an "Opened" toast (distinct wording from Revert). *(verified: 4 Open + 4 Revert buttons for arc-lifecycle v4–v1; Open v2 → badge "🕘 v2", modal closed)*
- [x] Revert behaviour is unchanged (still present, still loads + toasts "Reverted"). *(revertToVersion untouched; 4 Revert buttons still render)*
- [x] `openVersionInPlace(id, v)` handles a failed `/api/version` fetch the same way revert does (alert, no crash). *(mirrors revert: `if (!res.ok) { alert(...); return; }` + try/catch)*
- [x] src↔build mirror invariant holds: `diff -q src/aef-workflow-designer.html build/gallery/designer.html`. *(MIRROR-OK)*
- [x] Playwright: open the Versions modal → click ⤢ Open on a non-latest version → the editor loads that version (verified: loaded-version badge = vN, node count matches that version), modal closed; 0 console errors; element screenshot READ. *(Open v2 → badge "🕘 v2", 14 nodes, modal closed; .playwright-mcp/t165-open-revert.png read; 0 console errors)*

### Human
- [x] [REVIEW] Open vs Revert reads clearly
  **Steps:**
  1. Open `http://localhost:8834/designer.html`, open a map with saved versions, click **🕘 Versions**.
  2. Click **⤢ Open** on an older version.
  **Expected:** The old version loads into the editor for viewing/editing; the action feels non-destructive and clearly distinct from Revert.
  **If not:** Note what was confusing about the two actions.

## Verification

diff -q src/aef-workflow-designer.html build/gallery/designer.html

# Shell commands that MUST pass before work-completed. One per line.
# Lines starting with # are comments (skipped). Empty lines ignored.
# The completion gate runs each command — if any exits non-zero, completion is blocked.
#
# Toolchain hint (L-291): if you edited *.vbproj/*.csproj/*.xaml add `dotnet build`;
# *.go → `go build ./...`; Cargo.toml → `cargo check`; tsconfig.json → `tsc --noEmit`;
# pom.xml → `mvn -q compile`. P-011 runs only what you write — broken builds slip
# past otherwise (origin: 003-NTB-ATC-Plugin T-077, broken WPF DLL on master 5 days).
#
# Pipefail/SIGPIPE hint (L-387): P-011 runs each command under `set -eo pipefail`.
# `cmd | grep -q PATTERN` exits 141 (SIGPIPE) when grep matches and closes stdin
# while the upstream is still writing — verification then "fails" even though
# the pattern was present. Safe pattern: capture first, grep the capture:
#     out=$(cmd 2>&1); echo "$out" | grep -q "PATTERN"
# Or:
#     cmd > /tmp/.out 2>&1 && grep -q "PATTERN" /tmp/.out
# Origin: L-387, captured 4× (T-1716, T-1838, T-1862, T-1863) before this hint.
#
# Single pipe only — no intermediate tail/awk/sed stages between capture and grep
# (T-2090): `echo "$out" | tail -3 | grep -q PAT` re-introduces the SIGPIPE risk
# the capture step closed off — the middle stage is what `grep -q` slams its
# stdin on. `echo "$out"` is small and immediate; grep scans the whole captured
# string anyway, so the tail-3 was cosmetic. Drop it: `echo "$out" | grep -q PAT`.
#
# Enforcement-baseline hint (L-398, T-1886): if you edited `.claude/settings.json`
# (added/removed/reorganised hooks), add `bin/fw enforcement baseline` to your
# Verification block. Otherwise the canonical hash diverges and `fw doctor`
# reports a FAIL ("Enforcement baseline CHANGED") that accumulates silently.
# Origin: T-1849/T-1730/T-1731 each added a legitimate hook without refreshing
# the baseline — FAIL sat for multiple sessions until T-1886 cleaned up.

## Recommendation

**Recommendation:** GO
**Rationale:** All agent ACs verified live. Each version row now offers ⤢ Open (non-destructive
load-in-place) beside ↩ Revert (unchanged). Opening v2 of arc-lifecycle set the loaded badge to
v2 and loaded 14 nodes. The remaining Human AC is a quick taste-check that Open vs Revert reads
clearly.
**Evidence:**
- `.playwright-mcp/t165-open-revert.png` (read): both buttons per row, v4–v1.
- Open v2 → badge "🕘 v2", modal closed, 14 nodes loaded. 0 console errors.
- Verification gate: `diff -q src build/gallery/designer.html` → PASS (MIRROR-OK).

## RCA

<!-- REQUIRED for bug-class tasks (workflow_type=build with bug-tag, OR title matches
     fix/bug/rca/broken/crash/error/regression/fail/hotfix).
     Non-bug-class tasks may leave this section empty or remove it.

     For bug-class, fill in:
       **Symptom:** what was observed (the user-facing manifestation).
       **Root cause:** the specific structural/logical gap — not "the code was wrong".
       **Why structurally allowed:** what in the framework/code/tooling let this go undetected.
       **Prevention:** what catches the next instance (test/lint/gate/doc/learning) — distinct from the fix itself.

     The completion gate (T-1550, G-019) blocks --status work-completed when
     bug-class AND this section is empty/template-only. Use --skip-rca to bypass (logged).
-->

## Evolution

<!-- REQUIRED for arc-tagged build tasks (tags include arc:*). Captures how
     understanding evolved during build — what was learned that wasn't known at
     filing, what in the original plan no longer fits, what triggered pivots
     or new sub-tasks. Mandatory at slice boundaries (when applicable) and
     before --status work-completed.

     Origin: T-1717 grill Q4 — "the understanding of what we need and want
     evolves with the process of materialisation." Structural counter to §ACD:
     spec-vs-build divergence is logged as soon as it happens, not lost as
     folklore.

     Format (one entry per slice boundary or significant insight):
       ### YYYY-MM-DD — [topic]
       - **What changed:** [what we learned that we didn't know at filing]
       - **Plan impact:** [what in the plan no longer fits]
       - **Triggered:** [new sub-task / pivot / scope cut, with task ID if filed]

     The completion gate (T-1718) blocks --status work-completed when this
     section exists but is empty/template-only. Use --skip-evolution to bypass
     (logged Tier-2). Non-arc tasks may leave this empty.
-->

## Decisions

<!-- Record decisions ONLY when choosing between alternatives.
     Skip for tasks with no meaningful choices.
     Format:
     ### [date] — [topic]
     - **Chose:** [what was decided]
     - **Why:** [rationale]
     - **Rejected:** [alternatives and why not]
-->

## Decision

<!-- Filled at completion of inception tasks via:
     fw inception decide T-XXX go|no-go|defer --rationale "..."

     For non-inception tasks this section is ignored. Kept in template
     so `fw inception decide` (lib/inception.sh) finds the anchor heading
     without auto-creating; T-1832 added auto-create as fallback for
     legacy tasks lacking this section. -->
