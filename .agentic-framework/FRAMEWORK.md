# Agentic Engineering Framework

> Provider-neutral operating guide for AI agents working in this repository.

## How to Use This Document

This document defines how any AI agent (Claude, GPT-4, Gemini, Llama, or others) should operate within this project. Provider-specific integration files may exist alongside this document:

- **Claude Code:** Reads `CLAUDE.md` (auto-loaded)
- **Cursor/Copilot:** Can read this file directly or create `.cursorrules`
- **Other LLMs:** Read this file as your operating guide

## Project Overview

The **Agentic Engineering Framework** is a governance framework for systematizing how AI agents work within engineering projects. This is not a traditional code library — it's a set of structural rules, patterns, and enforcement mechanisms for agentic workflows.

**Works with:** Any file-based, CLI-capable AI agent environment.

## Core Principle

**Nothing gets done without a task.** This is enforced structurally by the framework, not by agent discipline.

## Four Constitutional Directives (Priority Order)

1. **Antifragility** — System strengthens under stress; failures are learning events
2. **Reliability** — Predictable, observable, auditable execution; no silent failures
3. **Usability** — Joy to use/extend/debug; sensible defaults; actionable errors
4. **Portability** — No provider/language/environment lock-in; prefer standards (MCP, LSP, OpenAPI)

## Authority Model

```
Human    →  SOVEREIGNTY  →  Can override anything, is accountable
Framework →  AUTHORITY   →  Enforces rules, checks gates, logs everything
Agent    →  INITIATIVE   →  Can propose, request, suggest — never decides
```

## Task System

### File Structure

```
.tasks/
  active/      # In-progress tasks (e.g., T-042-add-oauth.md)
  completed/   # Finished tasks
  templates/   # Task templates (default.md, inception.md)
```

### Task File Format

Tasks are Markdown with YAML frontmatter. Use `default.md` as template.

**Required frontmatter fields:**
- `id`, `name`, `description`, `status`, `workflow_type`, `owner`, `created`, `last_update`

**Body sections:**
- Context (design docs, specs, predecessor tasks), Updates (chronological log)

### Task Lifecycle

```
Captured → Started Work ↔ Issues → Work Completed
```

Four statuses: `captured`, `started-work`, `issues`, `work-completed`.

### Workflow Types

| Type | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| Specification | Define what to build |
| Design | Determine how to build |
| Build | Create implementation |
| Test | Verify correctness |
| Refactor | Improve existing code |
| Decommission | Remove obsolete code |
| Inception | Explore problem space, validate assumptions, go/no-go decision |

## Arc System

An **arc** is a multi-task workspace grouping work by theme — the
longitudinal narrative around multiple tasks pursuing one
user-observable mechanic. Where a task answers "what are we doing
right now," an arc answers "what is the whole thing this row of
tasks is in service of, and how will we know when it's done?"

Arcs are **optional**. Standalone tasks remain first-class. Use an
arc when work spans more than ~3 tasks with a shared headline mechanic.

### Arc File Structure

Arcs live as YAML files in `.context/arcs/`. The filename stem is
the *slug* (human-readable); the YAML `id:` field is the *immutable
numeric id* (`arc-NNN`, allocated sequentially at create-time).
Either form routes to the same arc.

### Arc Lifecycle (Four States)

```
draft  ──── fw arc start ────► in-progress ──── fw arc close ────► closed
   │                                │
   └── fw arc abandon ──┐  ┌── fw arc abandon ┘
                        ▼  ▼
                    abandoned
```

| State | Meaning |
|-------|---------|
| `draft` | Created, not yet active. Use for arcs spec'd ahead of pickup. |
| `in-progress` | Active work. Default after `fw arc start`. |
| `closed` | Shipped. `demo_evidence` captured. Terminal. |
| `abandoned` | No longer pursued. `abandonment_reason` captured. Terminal. |

Terminal transitions (`close`, `abandon`) are refused under
`$CLAUDECODE=1` — closure decisions belong to the human via Watchtower
review (T-1671 §ACD/G-062 Default-to-OPEN gate).

### Task ↔ Arc Membership

A task joins an arc via `arc_id:` in its frontmatter (slug or arc-NNN
form). A PreToolUse hook refuses edits to tasks whose `arc_id:` does
not resolve to a registered arc (bypass: `FW_ALLOW_ARC_ID_DRIFT=1`).

### D-Immutability

Arc identifiers are append-only: no renumber, no reuse, no delete.
Slug rename is permitted but rare. The historical record is the
artefact. See `012-ArcSystem.md` for the full invariant.

For the complete reference (fields, audit checks, Watchtower surface,
CLI verbs), see **[012-ArcSystem.md](012-ArcSystem.md)**.

## Enforcement Tiers

| Tier | Description | Bypass | Implementation |
|------|-------------|--------|----------------|
| 0 | Consequential actions (force push, hard reset, rm -rf /, DROP TABLE) | Human approval via `fw tier0 approve` | PreToolUse hook on Bash (check-tier0.sh) |
| 1 | All standard operations (default) | Create task or escalate to Tier 2 | PreToolUse hook on Write/Edit (check-active-task.sh) |
| 2 | Human situational authorization | Single-use, mandatory logging | Git --no-verify + bypass log |
| 3 | Pre-approved categories (health checks, status queries, git-status) | Configured | Defined in 011-EnforcementConfig.md |

## Working with Tasks

When starting work (**BEFORE reading code, editing files, or invoking external workflows**):
1. Check for existing task or create new one following `default.md` template
2. Set status to `started-work`
3. Set focus on the task: `fw context focus T-XXX`
4. THEN proceed with implementation
5. Log every action in Updates section with: action, output, context snapshot

When encountering issues:
1. Set status to `issues`
2. Log error reference and healing loop suggestions
3. Record resolution when fixed for pattern learning

When completing:
1. Verify all acceptance criteria met
2. Set status to `work-completed`
3. Generate episodic summary for future reference

## Context Integration

Tasks feed three memory types:
- **Working Memory** — Active task status and pending actions
- **Project Memory** — Patterns across all tasks (failure modes, effective approaches)
- **Episodic Memory** — Completed task histories for future reference

## Error Escalation Ladder

1. **A** — Don't repeat the same failure
2. **B** — Improve technique
3. **C** — Improve tooling
4. **D** — Change ways of working

## Agents

Each agent has a bash script (mechanical) and AGENT.md (intelligence/guidance).

| Agent | Location | Purpose | Command |
|-------|----------|---------|---------|
| Task Create | `agents/task-create/` | Create new tasks | `fw task create --name "..." --type build` |
| Task Update | `agents/task-create/` | Change task status | `fw task update T-XXX --status ...` |
| Audit | `agents/audit/` | Check compliance | `fw audit` |
| Session Capture | `agents/session-capture/` | Ensure nothing lost | See `AGENT.md` checklist |
| Git | `agents/git/` | Enforce traceability | `fw git commit -m "T-XXX: ..."` |
| Handover | `agents/handover/` | Session continuity | `fw handover --commit` |
| Context | `agents/context/` | Manage memory fabric | `fw context init` |
| Healing | `agents/healing/` | Error recovery | `fw healing diagnose T-XXX` |
| Resume | `agents/resume/` | Post-compaction recovery | `fw resume status` |
| Observe | `agents/observe/` | Capture anomalies | `fw observe "description"` |
| Dispatch | `agents/dispatch/` | Sub-agent prompt templates | Read templates before dispatching |

## Session Protocols

### Session Start
1. Initialize context: `fw context init`
2. Read `.context/handovers/LATEST.md` to understand current state
3. Review the "Suggested First Action" section
4. Set focus: `fw context focus T-XXX`
5. Run `fw metrics` to see project status

### Mid-Session Recovery (after context compaction)
1. Run resume: `fw resume status`
2. Sync working memory: `fw resume sync`
3. Continue from recommendations

### Session End
1. Run session capture checklist (`agents/session-capture/AGENT.md`)
2. Create tasks for all uncaptured work
3. Update practices with learnings
4. Generate handover: `fw handover --commit`
5. Fill in the [TODO] sections in the handover document
6. Run `fw metrics` to verify state

**Do not end a session without generating a handover.**

## fw CLI

The `fw` command is the single entry point for all framework operations:

```bash
fw help              # Show all commands
fw version           # Show version and paths
fw doctor            # Check framework health
fw audit             # Run compliance audit
fw metrics           # Show project metrics
fw context init      # Initialize session
fw context focus T-XXX
fw git commit -m "T-XXX: description"
fw handover --commit # Generate and commit handover
fw task create --name "Fix bug" --type build --owner human
fw work-on "name" --type build  # Create task + set focus + start
fw healing diagnose T-XXX
fw promote suggest   # Check graduation candidates
fw tier0 approve     # Approve a blocked destructive command
```

## Glossary

| Term | Definition |
|------|------------|
| **Antifragility** | Constitutional directive #1. The system strengthens under stress — failures become learning events that improve future behavior, not just errors to recover from. |
| **Arc** | A multi-task workspace grouping work by theme. Holds the longitudinal narrative around several tasks pursuing one user-observable mechanic. Has a four-state lifecycle (`draft → in-progress → closed/abandoned`), an immutable `arc-NNN` id, and a human-readable slug. Optional — tasks without an arc remain first-class. See `012-ArcSystem.md`. |
| **D-Immutability** | The arc-system axiom that identifiers are append-only: no renumber, no reuse, no delete. Slug rename is permitted but rare. The historical record (including closed and abandoned arcs) is the artefact. |
| **Blast Radius** | The set of downstream components affected by a change. Computed by the Component Fabric via `fw fabric blast-radius`. |
| **Context Fabric** | The persistent memory system managed by the Context Agent. Stores working memory (session state), project memory (patterns, decisions), and episodic memory (task histories). Lives in `.context/`. |
| **Enforcement Tiers** | Four levels of action governance. Tier 0: human-approved destructive actions. Tier 1: standard operations (require active task). Tier 2: human situational overrides. Tier 3: pre-approved safe operations. |
| **Episodic Memory** | Condensed history of completed tasks — what was done, what worked, what failed. Auto-generated on task completion. Stored in `.context/episodic/`. Used by agents to learn from past experience. |
| **Healing Loop** | The antifragile error-recovery cycle: classify failure, look up similar patterns, suggest recovery, log resolution. Triggered when a task enters `issues` status. See `fw healing`. |
| **Horizon** | Priority scheduling field on tasks. `now` = ready to work on, `next` = ready after current work, `later` = parked/backlog. Controls handover suggestions and task ordering. |
| **Inception** | A workflow type for exploring a problem space before committing to build. Produces a go/no-go decision with evidence. Build tasks are created separately after a GO decision. See `050-Inceptions.md` for the lifecycle, disposition gate, scoring exception (`target_blast_radius` + VoI), three-tier adjudication, and park-state semantics. |
| **Project Memory** | Patterns, decisions, and learnings accumulated across all tasks. Persists between sessions. Stored in `.context/project/`. |
| **Sovereignty** | The human's absolute authority in the Authority Model. Humans can override anything but are accountable for the outcome. Structural gates enforce sovereignty — agents cannot bypass them. |
| **Working Memory** | Active session state: current focus, pending actions, recent context. Lives in `.context/working/`. Refreshed each session via `fw context init`. |
| **BVP (Business Value Points)** | A directive-weighted score on tasks/arcs: `Σ(driver_weight × driver_score)` where score is 0–5 and weight is 0–9. Surfaces high-value/low-cost work in the quadrant view. Adapted from Geelen 2019; see `040-ValueDrivers.md`. |
| **Value Driver** | A named dimension along which work is scored. Carries a weight (integer 0–9). Total drivers (protected + free) ≤ 9. See `040-ValueDrivers.md`. |
| **Free Driver** | A project-level value driver beyond the four constitutional directives. Up to 5 per project; adding a 6th triggers M1 add-one-drop-one. Managed via `fw bvp driver --add/--remove` (§ACD). |
| **Arc-Scoped Driver** | A driver registered on a single arc, distinguishing what the global directives don't capture. Cap 3 per arc, weight ≤ 6 (M2). Managed via `fw arc approve-driver` (§ACD). |
| **Directive Scoring** | The per-task act of assigning 0–5 to each driver. Calibrated to ±1 across independent scorers; rubric in `policy/bvp-scoring-rubric.md`. |
| **Quadrant** | The split of the task list on median BVP × median cost (`hv-lc`, `hv-hc`, `lv-lc`, `lv-hc`). Medians are recomputed live each invocation — no calibration thresholds to set. |

## Installation

### Quick install

```bash
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/DimitriGeelen/agentic-engineering-framework/master/install.sh | bash
```

This checks prerequisites, clones to `~/.agentic-framework`, links `fw` to PATH, and runs `fw doctor`.

Set `INSTALL_DIR` to customize: `INSTALL_DIR=/opt/framework curl -fsSL .../install.sh | bash`

### Manual install

```bash
git clone https://github.com/DimitriGeelen/agentic-engineering-framework.git ~/.agentic-framework
sudo ln -sf ~/.agentic-framework/bin/fw /usr/local/bin/fw
fw doctor
```

### Verify

```bash
fw version
fw doctor
```

## Isolation Model (T-1189/G-031)

The framework supports two canonical isolation patterns:

| Pattern | Mechanism | Use case |
|---------|-----------|----------|
| **Vendored dir** | `fw init` / `fw vendor` copies framework into `.agentic-framework/` | Consumer projects (default) |
| **Shim dispatch** | `bin/fw-shim` detects project, routes to vendored copy | Multi-project environments |

**How it works:** `fw init /path/to/project` calls `do_vendor()` which copies `bin/`, `lib/`, `agents/`, `web/`, `docs/`, `.tasks/templates/`, `FRAMEWORK.md`, and `metrics.sh` into the project's `.agentic-framework/` directory. The project is then self-contained. The shim (`~/.local/bin/fw`) detects which project you're in and routes to that project's vendored copy.

**Upgrading:** `fw upgrade /path/to/project` syncs the vendored copy from the framework repo. It delegates to the same `do_vendor()` function, ensuring the same files are synced.

**Legacy patterns to avoid:**
- Manual `cp` from framework to project — use `fw vendor` instead
- Symlinks into framework repo — breaks project isolation
- Oversized global install at `~/.agentic-framework` — the shim obsoletes this

`fw doctor` checks for problematic patterns (nested vendored dirs, oversized global installs).

## Setting Up a New Project

```bash
# Initialize project (auto-detects interactive mode)
fw init /path/to/project

# Then:
cd /path/to/project
fw doctor           # Verify setup
fw context init     # Start first session
fw work-on "First task" --type build
```

### Updating the framework

From within any project that uses the framework:

```bash
fw update            # pulls latest changes into your framework installation
```

Or manually update the framework repo:

```bash
cd /path/to/agentic-engineering-framework
git pull
```

Projects reference the framework via `framework_path` in `.framework.yaml`. After updating the framework installation, all projects pointing to it will use the new version on their next `fw` invocation.
