"""review_policy.py — the ONE place the IW-7 review strength is computed (T-3580 round 6).

`fw reviewer judge` (lib/reviewer/judge_cli.py) uses it to pick the rung it dispatches, and the
verdict ledger (lib/verdict_ledger.py) uses the SAME functions to decide which rung a green must
have to count, at `record` and at every `apply`. Before round 6 the rung lived only in the judge,
so a review dispatch could record a green with a lower `--rung` and no run and the ledger ticked
it (second-family review, HIGH: docs/reports/T-3580-second-family-codex.md).

IW-7 (docs/reports/T-3557-agent-reviewer-default.md): impact = max(cost_if_wrong, value_at_stake)
over reversibility, blast radius, audience, value and uncertainty. low -> rung 1 (same-vendor
independent agent), medium -> rung 3 (one TermLink-dispatched reviewer), high -> rung 5 (panel of
three vendors). The weekly spend ceiling may drop the rung one step; that step-down is a
DECISION the ledger computes when it registers the review run (round 7), from the committed cost
ledger, and re-verifies (`verify_ceiling_decision`) at record and apply — never a caller's claim.

Impact is monotonic in the criteria it reads: adding criteria can only raise the tier. So the
judge, which scores all the criteria it dispatches together, never asks for less than the ledger
demands for any one of them.

#     an ancestor of HEAD, append-only against git), never from an untracked working file;
#   * ceiling and spend must be finite and >= 0, and the ceiling must be at least CEILING_FLOOR.
