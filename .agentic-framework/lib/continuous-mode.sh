# Continuous-run counters (T-3169, arc-012 S3).
#
# `.continuous-mode.yaml` carries TWO ceilings, counted in different units:
#
#   current_iteration / max_iterations  — SESSIONS. Advanced by SessionStart
#       (agents/context/inject-next-directive.py). Bounds how many context
#       windows one run may consume.
#   tasks_completed   / max_tasks       — TASKS. Advanced here, on the
#       work-completed transition. Bounds how much WORK one run may do.
#
# They are not interchangeable and neither substitutes for the other. Before
# T-3164 the two were the same number by accident, because a session could only
# take one turn and the run advanced a window per unit of work; `max_iterations: 5`
# therefore meant "five units of work" AND "five 285K windows" at once. With a Stop
# hook driving turns inside one window, many tasks now fit in a single session, and
# the session counter can no longer see any of them. The operator reasons in tasks;
# the budget is spent in sessions. Both get a ceiling.

# STOP AND NOTIFY, DO NOT PARK AND TAKE THE NEXT TASK (T-3212, arc-012 IW-5).
#
# The stop-driver already asks the agent, in prose, to stop when it reaches a
# human-owned decision. Nothing enforced it — which is the same shape the driver's
# own header attributes to T-2404: a repair that presumes the very turn it is
# trying to cause. This is that stop, made structural.
#
# Why stop rather than park-and-next: 280+ tasks already sit awaiting operator
# review. A loop that treats a human gate as a routing hint keeps spending budget
# growing a queue nobody is draining, and then ends later on an unrelated cap with
# the real blocker nowhere in the record.
#
# Why record a REASON and not just disarm: `enabled: false` names the flag, not
# what set it. `.stop-driver.log` is 25 consecutive
# `continuous-mode-disabled(enabled=False)` lines, in which "the operator never
# armed it" and "the loop disarmed itself on a gate" are indistinguishable — the
# false-green shape this project keeps finding, one layer up. `last_terminated_reason`
# is what makes the two legible apart; stop-driver.sh reads it back.
#
# Same fail-safe posture as fw_continuous_note_task_completed, for the same reason:
# this runs on the completion path of every task in the project, so every ambiguous

# what_remains named the class it did NOT cover: `last_terminated_reason` is a
# one-way latch (bin/claude-fw:388's `_continuous_terminated` reads it back
# verbatim, never re-evaluating whether the thing that set it is still true).
# `.stop-driver.log` is where every restart attempt records the SAME stale
# reason, one line per attempt, and nothing reads that log for repetition — it
# is pure text, appended forever, checked by no instrument (T-3262's own comment
# says as much about the sibling ledger).
#
# This does not assume the stale reason is a human-gate, or that repeats land
# seconds apart (G-099 imagined "cycling every few seconds"; the real recurrence
# T-3268 measured was every few MINUTES over 2.5+ hours) — it just counts how
# many times the IDENTICAL (stored_ts, cause) pair shows up as a `decision=stop`
# line within the trailing window. A latch being replayed at all past the
# threshold is the signal; how fast or why is a detail for the caller to add.
#
# Prints one tab-separated line `count<TAB>stored_ts<TAB>cause<TAB>first_ts<TAB>last_ts`
# to stdout when a (stored_ts, cause) pair recurs >= threshold times inside the
# window; prints nothing otherwise. Always exits 0 — same fail-safe posture as
# the rest of this file: a detector that can crash `fw doctor` or the daily

# fw_continuous_cli <arm|disarm|status> [opts]   — T-3225
#
# The loop shipped disarmed (T-3164, for cause: the flag used to claim armed
# while structurally terminated) and no verb was ever built to arm it again.
# Arming meant hand-editing five fields across TWO files, and the second file
# is the one nobody remembered:
#
#   .continuous-mode.yaml   enabled, current_iteration, last_terminated_reason
#   .next-directive.yaml    filed_at, expires_at   <-- the expiry the driver READS
#
# stop-driver.sh takes expires_at from the DIRECTIVE first (stop-driver.sh:188),
# falling back to state.expires_after_seconds + directive.filed_at. So a run can
# be `enabled: true` and still stop dead on a directive expiry from months ago.
# Both legs are set together here, or not at all.
#
# `status` re-evaluates the predicate chain LIVE. It prints
# last_terminated_reason only as an explicitly-labelled stored string, because
# that is what the driver replays: for 74 days the log read "expires_at
# 2026-06-17 passed (now 2026-08-26)" — a frozen `now`, recited rather than
# computed, which reads as current and is not.
# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------

# resolved from FRAMEWORK_ROOT and only falls back to the project tree.
#
# It used to be "${root}/agents/context/inject-next-directive.py", with root =
# PROJECT_ROOT. That path exists in THIS repo (where the two roots coincide) and
# nowhere else. On any consumer project the import raised FileNotFoundError, which
# `_emit_json` correctly refuses to treat as a green light -- so `may_inject` was
# false forever and the driver could never fire. Fail-safe, and completely inert:

# is not to re-type them in the driver -- it is to have ONE evaluator and give it a
# second output shape. `verdict()` above is that evaluator; this adds the shape.
#

# all six in one place:
#   - `terminated`: a recorded death. T-3167 makes a terminating write also disarm,
#     so this is strictly narrower than `enabled` and never disagrees with it -- but
#     it is reported separately because "never armed" and "armed, then stopped" mean
#     opposite things to whoever reads the refusal.
#   - `ceiling_breached`: needs the planned next action AND its blast-radius, which
#     is the injector's join, so the injector's own functions are imported rather
#     than reimplemented. An unresolvable radius is NOT a breach (the enforcer's own

# E2-armed-*) produced exactly ONE decision=continue and then:
#
#   decision=stop reason=stop_hook_active=true (platform runaway guard)
#
# Brake 3a is checked BEFORE the caps (stop-driver.sh:87-101), and Claude Code sets
# stop_hook_active on every stop that follows a hook-driven continuation. So the
# second stop of any run yields there, and expiry / max_tasks are never consulted.
# The driver's own header says "our counter is meant to stop the loop first, leaving
# the vendor's cap as the backstop we did not write" — that intent is not met, and
# stating unreachable bounds as the operative ones is the false-green class this arc
# exists to remove. Whether the cap SHOULD be one turn is a sovereignty decision for
# the operator, not something to quietly widen here; T-3240 carries it.
