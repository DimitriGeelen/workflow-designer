# fw init - Bootstrap a new project with the Agentic Engineering Framework
#
# Creates the directory structure, config files, and git hooks needed
# for a project to use the framework.

# T-3064 (A2/A4): install the pinned Workflow Designer build into a
# freshly-onboarded project.
#
# Before this, a consumer received policy/designer-pin.yaml — a declaration naming
# an artifact — and never the artifact, so /designer rendered an error page in
# every project but this repo. `fw designer install` copies the build that ships
# inside .agentic-framework/ and verifies its sha256 against that same vendored pin
# before installing it read-only (T-2521's check, unchanged — see the A3 note in
# agents/designer/designer.sh:do_install).
#
# A4 — no network and no hang: the bytes are already on disk, `--from-tag` (the
# one path that reaches 832's internal OneDev) is not reachable from here, and
# every outcome prints a line. Init is never failed by this step — a project
# without a designer is still a governed project — but it is never SILENT about
# it either, which is the half that was missing.
#
# Inputs: $1 — target project dir
# Return: 0 always (advisory step)

    # missed the enforcement baseline and all five seeded onboarding tasks. A
    # worktree cut from that commit had `.tasks/` but no tasks in it, which is
    # the populated-looking-but-broken state this fix exists to prevent.

    # `git init` alone leaves HEAD unborn (`git rev-parse HEAD` → exit 128).
    # Claude Code's background-session isolation (`EnterWorktree`) preflights

    # means refuses every Write/Edit — deadlocking the very first background
    # session before it can write anything, including its own task file.
    #
    # The commit stages what `fw init` just created (T-2827). An EMPTY commit
    # is NOT sufficient and was the original T-2821 defect: it gives a HEAD that
    # resolves but whose TREE has zero files, so `git worktree add` checks out
    # nothing and still yields an empty worktree — the same user-visible failure
    # as OBS-175 via a different mechanism (empty-tree checkout rather than
    # orphan inference). Measured live in T-2826 on published bytes: worktree
    # held 1 entry (`.git`), no CLAUDE.md. Resolvability was a PROXY for the
    # property the real use needs, which is "HEAD has content", and the proxy
    # diverged from the thing (OBS-178).
    #
    # Everything staged, not a curated subset: a background agent needs
    # CLAUDE.md, .claude/, .tasks/, .context/ AND .agentic-framework/ — without
    # the vendored CLI there is no `fw` in the worktree and no governance runs
    # at all, so a partial commit produces a worktree that LOOKS populated and
    # is still broken. All of it is framework-owned (9 top-level entries that
    # `fw init` itself just wrote), so this makes no decision about the
    # operator's project content, and onboarding task T-003 ("First governed
    # commit") still asks for exactly that. See T-2827 Decisions.

    # Placed AFTER git hooks are installed (above) so this commit is validated
    # BY the project's own commit-msg + pre-commit hooks (task-ref check,

    # bypassing them with --no-verify — shipping every project with a bypass
    # in its first commit would be worse than the bug (T-2821 hard rule).
    # T-2821 noted an empty commit satisfies the scan/large-file/dup-id hooks
    # TRIVIALLY (no staged diff to inspect) — which is precisely why it was weak
    # evidence that the hooks work. A populated commit actually exercises them.
    # Verified live (T-2826 LEG6): staging all 2353 files and committing passes
    # every hook with no --no-verify. The commit-msg hook only requires a
    # `T-[0-9]+` pattern, so `T-000` — the framework's own established

Project configuration for the Agentic Engineering Framework.

## Project Overview

**Project:** $project_name

## Core Principle

**Nothing gets done without a task.** This is enforced structurally by the framework.

## Framework Integration

This project uses the Agentic Engineering Framework as shared tooling.

\`\`\`bash
# All operations go through fw
fw help                              # See all commands
fw task create --name "..." --type build --owner human
fw git commit -m "T-XXX: description"
fw audit                             # Check compliance
fw context status                    # View context state
fw handover --commit                 # End-of-session handover
\`\`\`

## Quick Reference

| Action | Command |
|--------|---------|
| Create task | \`fw task create\` |
| Commit | \`fw git commit -m "T-XXX: ..."\` |
| Audit | \`fw audit\` |
| Initialize session | \`fw context init\` |
| Set focus | \`fw context focus T-XXX\` |
| Handover | \`fw handover --commit\` |
| Health check | \`fw doctor\` |
| Metrics | \`fw metrics\` |

## Session Protocol

**Start:** \`fw context init\` → read handover → \`fw context focus T-XXX\`
**End:** session capture → \`fw handover --commit\`

    # T-1364 (G-053-A): hook commands must NOT be CWD-relative — Claude Code
    # resolves them against the session CWD, and CWD drift (test fixtures, subdir
    # navigation) cascades into hook-cannot-find-fw tool-blocks (680 silent
    # failures at 003-NTB-ATC-Plugin, see T-1504).

    # host's checkout path — into the emitted string, which breaks on every other
    # host. ${CLAUDE_PROJECT_DIR} is expanded by Claude Code to the project root
    # before the hook runs, so it is absolute-after-expansion (T-1364's constraint

# /resume - Context Recovery for Agentic Engineering Framework

When the user says `/resume`, "pick up", or "continue", execute this workflow.

## Step 1: Gather State

Run these in parallel:

1. Read `.context/handovers/LATEST.md`
2. Run `git status --short` and `git log --oneline -5`
3. List `.tasks/active/` and extract task IDs, names, and statuses from frontmatter
4. Check tool counter: `cat .context/working/.tool-counter`
5. Check web server: `WURL=$(cat .context/working/watchtower.url 2>/dev/null || echo "http://localhost:$(bin/fw config get PORT 2>/dev/null || echo 3000)"); curl -sf "$WURL/" > /dev/null && echo "running at $WURL" || echo "stopped"`
   (Never hard-code `:3000` — the triple file `.context/working/watchtower.{pid,port,url}` is the single source of truth for Watchtower's current port. See `bin/fw doctor` for diagnostics.)

## Step 2: Summarize

Present this format (fill from gathered data):

```
## Context Restored

**Last Handover:** {session_id} ({timestamp})
**Last Commit:** {hash} - {message}
**Branch:** {branch}

### Where We Are
{paste the "Where We Are" section from LATEST.md}

### Active Tasks
- {T-XXX}: {name} ({status})

### Current State
- Git: {clean/N uncommitted files}
- Web UI: {running at {URL from .context/working/watchtower.url} / stopped}
- Tool counter: {N} (P-009)

### Suggested Action
{paste from LATEST.md "Suggested First Action" section}
```

## Step 3: Offer Next Steps

List the logical next actions as plain text (numbered). Derive from:
- The handover's "Suggested First Action"
- Any tasks with status `started-work`
- Uncommitted changes that need attention

Then ask: "What would you like to work on?"

## Rules

- Do NOT use AskUserQuestion (may be blocked in dontAsk mode) — use plain text
- Keep output concise — no commentary
- If LATEST.md has unfilled `[TODO]` sections, warn about stale handover
- If tool counter > 0 at session start, the PostToolUse hook is working

# Cursor Rules - Agentic Engineering Framework

## Project: $project_name

## Core Rule
Nothing gets done without a task. Every commit must reference a task ID (T-XXX).

## Framework Commands
All operations go through the \`fw\` CLI:
- \`fw task create --name "..." --type build --owner human\`
- \`fw git commit -m "T-XXX: description"\`
- \`fw audit\` — Check compliance
- \`fw handover --commit\` — End-of-session handover

## Session Protocol
Start: \`fw context init\` → read handover → \`fw context focus T-XXX\`
End: session capture → \`fw handover --commit\`
