# lib/release.sh - Release tagging + GitHub Release automation (T-1256)
#
# Cuts a new annotated tag based on the latest v* tag (bumping patch by default),
# pushes to all remotes with --follow-tags, and creates a GitHub Release if gh
# is available. Idempotent: exits cleanly when there are no commits since the
# latest tag.
#
# Designed to be run from cron on a weekly schedule and manually via `fw release`.
