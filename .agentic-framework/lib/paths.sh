# T-2289 (OBS-053 3-incident class): re-derive TASKS_DIR/CONTEXT_DIR when
# they were inherited from a different PROJECT_ROOT. Symptom: shell A exports
# TASKS_DIR=/project-A/.tasks via `fw context init`; a subprocess in project B
# with `PROJECT_ROOT=/project-B fw …` inherits the stale /project-A/.tasks and
# writes go to the wrong project. The `:-` default below silently keeps the
# inherited value when non-empty.
#
# Fix: the `_FW_PATHS_DERIVED_BY` sentinel records the PROJECT_ROOT that
# originally derived the path vars. When it's present AND differs from the
# current PROJECT_ROOT, the inherited paths are stale — unset them so the
# `:-` defaults below re-derive from PROJECT_ROOT.
#
# Test-fixture invariant: when `TASKS_DIR` is set in the SAME shell as
# `PROJECT_ROOT` with no prior derivation, `_FW_PATHS_DERIVED_BY` is empty,
# the unset block is skipped, and the explicit `TASKS_DIR` survives intact

#
# T-2465 (generalizes T-2463 / OBS-080): a framework hook can execute a `bin/fw`
# other than the one belonging to the tree the tool actually ran in, so it reads the
# wrong focus.yaml / tasks / context.
#
# T-2709 UPDATE — the original wording here said "every framework hook is wired into
# settings.json by MAIN's absolute path (`<main>/bin/fw hook …`)". That premise is now
# FALSE: both generators emit `${CLAUDE_PROJECT_DIR}/bin/fw hook …`, which Claude Code
# expands to the session's project root. In a worktree session that resolves to the
# WORKTREE root, so the worktree's own bin/fw executes — the opposite of main-anchoring.
# The mismatch this function corrects therefore has two possible shapes now:
#   (a) legacy settings.json still carrying main's baked absolute path  → main's fw runs
#   (b) placeholder form                                                → worktree's fw runs
# In (b) the anchoring is usually already correct and this function degrades to a no-op
# (it compares against the resolved root and returns unchanged on a match). Note a
# worktree may carry a different framework VERSION than main, so under (b) the executing
# fw can differ in behaviour from main's — directionally an improvement (the tool runs
# the code of the tree it acted on), but worth knowing when debugging.
#
# Either way, bin/fw may still resolve PROJECT_ROOT from the hook's process cwd /
# inherited env rather than from the tree the tool ran in — which is what this fixes.
# Claude Code passes the authoritative per-call working dir as top-level `cwd` on
# the hook's stdin JSON ("working directory when the event fired"); this re-anchors
# to it. Per-call stdin cwd is FRESH (not inherited), so it is immune to the
# T-2446 daemon-poison class that limits CLAUDE_PROJECT_DIR trust.
#
# No-op when <cwd> is empty, not a dir, resolves to no project root, or already
# == PROJECT_ROOT — so normal (non-worktree) sessions are unaffected. Keeps
# _FW_PATHS_DERIVED_BY consistent (T-2289). Callers that cache their own
# PROJECT_ROOT-derived paths (FOCUS_FILE, STATUS_FILE, …) must recompute after.

# T-3038 (OBS-291): resolve the focus file for THIS session.
#
# Focus was per-project global state: one `.context/working/focus.yaml` shared by
# the parent session and every worker it dispatches. That is an unavoidable
# converging write that no task declares as a component, so `fw write-set check`
# returns rc=2 (undecidable) for every pair — the disjointness check cannot see it.
#
# The failure is not a lost write, it is a LOCKOUT. `fw context focus` stamps
# `focus_session` alongside `current_task`, and check-active-task.sh:448 blocks
# when that stamp does not match the running session. So a dispatched worker
# calling `fw work-on` flips the shared file to its own task and its own session
# id, and the PARENT is then refused on every Write AND every Bash — including
# read-only ls/cat/grep (the G-078 class). The parent is locked out of its own
# unrelated work by a worker it spawned. Recovery (`fw context focus T-PARENT`)
# is racy: the next `fw work-on` in any worker re-hijacks it.
#
# The fix is to give workers their own file. When FW_SESSION_SCOPED_FOCUS=1, focus
# reads and writes go to `focus.<key>.yaml` and the shared file is never touched,
# so the parent's task and session stamp survive untouched.
#
# The key must be stable for the worker's whole lifetime and distinct per worker.
# Preference order, first non-empty wins:
#   FW_FOCUS_SESSION_KEY  explicit override; what `fw termlink dispatch` exports
#                         (the worker name, which is unique per dispatch)
#   TERMLINK_SESSION      set by TermLink itself when a session owns the shell
#   PPID                  last-resort fallback — correct per-process, but not
#                         stable if the parent shell is replaced, hence last
#
# Default (unset/0) returns the shared path verbatim: existing single-session
# behaviour is unchanged, which is what keeps this safe to land without migration.
#
# T-3141: honour a CONTEXT_DIR override instead of re-deriving "$root/.context".
# Callers always pass PROJECT_ROOT as $1, but tests (create_task.bats, T-2832)
# sandbox CONTEXT_DIR alone — leaving PROJECT_ROOT pointed at the real repo so
# template resolution still works — to stop --start's focus write from landing
# in the live session's .context/working/. Re-deriving from root here defeated
# that sandbox and clobbered the live focus.yaml. Fall back to "$root/.context"
# only when CONTEXT_DIR is unset/empty, so non-test callers are unaffected.

# T-3422: pre-seed a session-scoped focus file with a known task.

# check-active-task.sh falls back to the SHARED focus.yaml while a scoped file
# does not exist yet (T-3038 — "a worker that never calls work-on should
# inherit the parent's task"). For a dispatched worker that inheritance is a
# defect, not a courtesy: the SEQ-T3411 value review watched four consecutive
# fresh workers read a different, unrelated, real active task as their own
# focus until their first `fw work-on`. Dispatch already knows the worker's
# task (`--task` is mandatory), so it seeds the scoped file up front and the
# fallback simply never fires for a dispatched worker.
#
# Resolves the path through fw_focus_file — the SAME resolver the gate and
# `fw context focus` use (L-399 producer/consumer parity) — so the caller sets
# FW_SESSION_SCOPED_FOCUS=1 and FW_FOCUS_SESSION_KEY=<name> exactly as it does
# for the worker's env.sh. `focus_session` is left null on purpose: the
# worker's own `fw work-on` stamps its session id later, and the gate's stamp
# comparison only fires when both sides are non-empty.
#
# Never overwrites: an existing scoped file is a worker's own state (possibly a
# re-dispatch under a reused name) and is left byte-identical.

# fw_task_view_dirs — enumerate every `.tasks/` VIEW of the task corpus (T-3104).
#
# A git worktree checks out its own snapshot of `.tasks/`, possibly behind (or
# ahead of) the main checkout. So "the task corpus" is not one directory — it is
# the UNION of every worktree's `.tasks/`. Any consumer that reasons about the
# corpus as a whole (ID allocation, duplicate-ID detection) must scan all views,
# or it will be blind to whatever the other views hold.
#
# WHY THIS EXISTS — split-view ID collision (L-506 leg 2, origin T-100202,
# 2026-07-21): an allocator computing max+1 over ONE view reads a stale max and
# mints an ID another view already used. That is not hypothetical — T-2505,
# T-2506 and T-2428 were each minted twice on 2026-07-01 across two worktrees.
#
# CONTRACT:
#   - Emits one absolute `.tasks/` path per line.
#   - Worktrees with no `.tasks/` directory are skipped (nothing to scan).
#   - `$TASKS_DIR` (the local view) is ALWAYS emitted, even when it is not a
#     directory and even when it does not appear in `git worktree list`. This is
#     the load-bearing guarantee: a symlinked or otherwise non-matching local
#     path must never fall out of the corpus.
#   - Non-git fallback: when `$TASKS_DIR`'s parent is not inside a git repo
#     (test harnesses, non-git consumers), the local view alone is returned —
#     no crash, no stderr.
#   - Output is DE-DUPLICATED, first-occurrence order preserved. Pre-lift the
#     local view was emitted twice (once from `git worktree list`, once from the
#     trailing append); the sole consumer piped through `sort -u`, so this
#     changes the multiset, never the SET — see docs/reports/T-3104-*.md.
#
# NOT THE SAME QUESTION AS `_wt_is_ignorable_path` (lib/worktree.sh). That
# predicate classifies `.tasks/` as a DELIVERABLE — a worktree whose only change
# is under `.tasks/` has real work that must land before teardown. Here `.tasks/`
# is CORPUS — a view to read IDs out of. Two callers, two correct answers. Do not
