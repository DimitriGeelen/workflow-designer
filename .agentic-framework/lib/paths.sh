# T-2289 (OBS-053 3-incident class): re-derive TASKS_DIR/CONTEXT_DIR when
# they were inherited from a different PROJECT_ROOT. Symptom: shell A exports
# TASKS_DIR=/project-A/.tasks via `fw context init`; a subprocess in project B
# with `PROJECT_ROOT=/project-B fw …` inherits the stale /project-A/.tasks and
# writes go to the wrong project. The `:-` default below silently keeps the
# inherited value when non-empty.
#
# Fix: the `_FW_PATHS_DERIVED_BY` sentinel records the PROJECT_ROOT that
# originally derived the path vars. When it's present AND differs from the
# current PROJECT_ROOT, the inherited paths are stale — unset them so the
# `:-` defaults below re-derive from PROJECT_ROOT.
#
# Test-fixture invariant: when `TASKS_DIR` is set in the SAME shell as
# `PROJECT_ROOT` with no prior derivation, `_FW_PATHS_DERIVED_BY` is empty,
# the unset block is skipped, and the explicit `TASKS_DIR` survives intact
# (this is what tests/unit/create_task.bats:18 relies on).

#
# T-2465 (generalizes T-2463 / OBS-080): every framework hook is wired into
# Claude Code settings.json by MAIN's absolute path (`<main>/bin/fw hook …`). When
# that hook fires inside a git-worktree (or spawned) session, bin/fw resolves
# PROJECT_ROOT from the hook's process cwd / inherited env — the MAIN repo — so the
# hook reads main's focus.yaml / tasks / context, NOT the worktree the tool ran in.
# Claude Code passes the authoritative per-call working dir as top-level `cwd` on
# the hook's stdin JSON ("working directory when the event fired"); this re-anchors
# to it. Per-call stdin cwd is FRESH (not inherited), so it is immune to the
# T-2446 daemon-poison class that limits CLAUDE_PROJECT_DIR trust.
#
# No-op when <cwd> is empty, not a dir, resolves to no project root, or already
# == PROJECT_ROOT — so normal (non-worktree) sessions are unaffected. Keeps
# _FW_PATHS_DERIVED_BY consistent (T-2289). Callers that cache their own
# PROJECT_ROOT-derived paths (FOCUS_FILE, STATUS_FILE, …) must recompute after.

# isolation model) the computed name (`-…-.claude-worktrees-…`) did NOT match
# Claude Code's actual dir (`-…--claude-worktrees-…`). find_transcript() then
# looked in a non-existent dir → "no transcript" → the token budget gauge was
# BLIND in every worktree session. This helper matches Claude Code's encoding.
