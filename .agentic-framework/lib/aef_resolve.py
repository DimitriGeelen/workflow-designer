"""T-3309 (arc-020 S3): regressive resolution + provisioning ladder.

Implements the ladder ratified in
docs/reports/T-3287-identity-taxonomy-circuit-model.md (D1, D4, D5, D7),
on top of the S1 address library (lib/aef_address.py — climb()/ladder()
supply the token-drop) and the S2 circuit registry (lib/aef_circuit.py —
the WriteClaim mechanism is imported, not duplicated).

The model carried here:

  - RESOLVE (find what exists) is ungated and SIDE-EFFECT-FREE (D5): the
    walk climbs 5->1 by dropping the rightmost address token
    (AEFAddress.climb) and probes each rung through an injectable
    endpoint-probe callable. Nothing else is touched.
  - The return contract is TRI-STATE, per the S2 Evolution handoff (D4-A
    sharpened during T-3308): a walk that COMPLETES and fails to find the
    endpoint is DEFINITIVE (``not-found``); a walk that cannot complete
    (a probe raises) is INDETERMINATE — the distinction lives in the
    return type, not in prose. death_test_walk() adapts this back into
    the found/not-found/raise contract CircuitRegistry.death_test binds.
  - PROVISION shares the SAME walk skeleton: resolve first, and only when
    the walk definitively finds nothing does it materialize the missing
    suffix TOP-DOWN (nearest existing ancestor first), through injectable
    per-level provisioner callables. Tier-3 pre-authorization extends
    through hub-standup ONLY (D5): a plan that would require standing up
    a HOST is refused — the host is the one rung the ladder may ask, never
    create.
  - The project is passive and path-bound (D2/D5 bound 3): a missing
    project PATH halts provisioning with a hand-to-S6 signal (fleet
    repo-sourcing). The ladder never creates project paths.
  - Provisioning a session acquires the per-project write-claim (D7,
    lib/aef_circuit.WriteClaim) BEFORE any fabric mutation and releases
    it when the descent ends.
  - Seams for later slices, pinned by tests: every provision decision
    passes through an injectable admission-check callable (S5 governor;
    default v1 = allow) and emits an audit row through an injectable
    audit-sink callable (S7; default appends to the result's own list).
    D5 bound 4: every auto-provision is logged, unconditionally.

Pure stdlib.

# ── S8: live termlink endpoint-probe (T-3338, arc-020) ───────────────────
#
# The resolve ladder (above) is deliberately probe-agnostic: it climbs the
# rungs and asks an injectable `probe(addr) -> bool` whether each exists.
# Slices S1–S7 shipped the ladder and its default filesystem probe; this
# builds the LIVE probe — the one that dispatches each rung to the real
# `termlink` binary — serving G3 (a dropped circuit is *detected* so it can
# self-heal). It stays additive: the pure-stdlib core above never imports
# subprocess; the invoke seam is pulled in lazily, and every test injects a
# fake so the unit suite needs no hub.
#
# THE CONTRACT THAT MATTERS (D4-A death-test, sharpened in S3 Evolution):
#   True   — the rung exists (the hub answered, affirmatively).
#   False  — the rung is DEFINITIVELY absent: the hub was reachable and
#            ANSWERED "not there". Only a hub verdict earns a False.
#   raise  — the world is UNKNOWABLE: the invoke failed, timed out, or the
#            hub could not be reached / returned no structured verdict. A
#            remote miss defaults here, never to False — calling an
#            unreachable endpoint "absent" is exactly how timeout-death
#            smuggles itself back into provisioning.
