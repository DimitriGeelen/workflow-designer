# lib/worktree.sh — fw worktree topology observability.
#
# T-2466 (T-2464 GO Candidate C, slice 2). Read-only. `fw worktree status [--json]`
# reports the git-worktree topology of the framework checkout:
#   - which branch the MAIN checkout is on, and whether it is master. The framework's
#     hooks are wired by MAIN's absolute path, so a fix only goes LIVE on this host when
#     MAIN's checked-out branch contains it — merging to master alone does NOT change the
#     on-disk hook here while main sits on a session branch.
#   - which worktree (if any) holds `master` checked out: while a worktree locks master,
#     `git checkout master` in main fails — you must `git push origin <branch>:master`.
#   - per-worktree merged-into-master? and live-on-this-host? state.
#
# merge-back is intentionally NOT here — it routes to `fw integrate` (arc-011,
# lib/integrate.py: check|classify; the mutating `fw integrate run` is arc-011's slice).
# `create` is a separate follow-up. This avoids duplicating the existing integrate surface.

# Resolve the "master" ref this repo integrates onto (local first, then origin).
# The trunk every landing verdict is measured against.
#
# REMOTE FIRST (T-3117). This used to prefer refs/heads/master, and in the
# session-on-master flow (T-100196) that ref is never updated: work lands by
# pushing `HEAD:master` from a topic branch, which advances origin/master and
# leaves the LOCAL master branch wherever it was. Measured here on 2026-08-23,
# local master was **1744 commits behind** origin/master — so every "has this
# landed?" answer in gc, `fw worktree status` and the branch-hygiene surfaces
# was computed against a trunk from six weeks earlier. Nothing could ever be
# reclaimed, which is why four stale worktrees survived R7's entire arc.
#
# "Landed" means on the SHARED trunk, so the remote-tracking ref is the
# correct subject, not a local bookmark that may be stale or ahead. A local
# master that is ahead of origin/master holds commits that are genuinely not
# landed yet; reporting them as landed would be the dangerous direction of
# this error, and preferring the remote gets that right too. The local refs
# stay as fallback for repos with no remote at all.

# The TRUNK under the release-train model (T-3185, T-3197).
#
# `master` stopped being the trunk when the release train landed: it is the
# consumer install surface and fast-forwards only at a release, so between
# releases it deliberately lags. Two things follow, and this repo had both wrong:
#
#   1. A worktree branched from master starts behind the dev branch. Its
#      merge-base is old, so `fw integrate check` reports both-sided files that
#      are not genuinely both-sided and inflates the needs-human verdict.
#   2. Work that HAS landed — via `fw integrate run bleeding-edge` — is not in
#      master until the next release, so a master-based "merged?" test answers
#      `no` for a branch that is fully landed. `lib/branch-hygiene.sh:100` already
#      resolves FW_DEV_BRANCH (T-3188); this file did not, so the two rails
#      disagreed about the same branch.
#
# Same remote-preferred order and the same rationale as _wt_master_ref above: a
# local dev branch that is ahead of origin holds commits that are genuinely not
# landed yet, and reporting those as landed is the dangerous direction.
#
# Falls back to _wt_master_ref when no dev branch exists, which keeps this a
# widening rather than a swap — a repo that never adopted the release train
# behaves exactly as it did before.

# whether the branch it points at is reachable from anywhere but this one working
# directory -- remove the worktree and any commits on that branch become invisible
# to the normal workflow (no cwd left to push from). Origin: T-2428/T-2825 -- a
# 6-commit branch survived `git worktree remove` only because that command doesn't
# delete branches, and sat unpushed for 5 weeks because nothing ever re-surfaced it.
#
# Guard: refuse removal when the worktree's branch holds commits that are absent
# from EVERY configured remote (i.e. no remote has all of the branch's commits).
# `--force` proceeds anyway and logs a Tier-2 entry to
# .context/working/.gate-bypass-log.yaml (same convention as lib/inception.sh,
# lib/review.sh). A repo with zero remotes configured cannot prove anything is
# pushed, so it is treated as unpushed too (fail closed).

# _wt_is_governance_path <relpath> -> 0 (true) when <relpath> is framework
# governance state, 1 otherwise.
#
# T-3102 / T-2822 -- governance state (.context/**, .tasks/**) is TRACKED
# content, so every linked worktree carries a FORK of it, and hooks firing in
# the MAIN session mutate that fork independently of anything the worktree's
# own work did. Measured on the four live worktrees at T-3102 time: 26/23,
# 5/4, 2/1, 17/15 dirty/governance. The dirt is not the worktree's work; it is
# ambient drift.
#
# T-2822's adopted GO settles what that dirt is WORTH: governance state inside
# a linked worktree is NON-AUTHORITATIVE BY CONSTRUCTION -- master is the
# authority, and the worktree's copy is a stale branch of it that nothing ever
# reads back. Discarding it loses nothing that master does not already hold.
#
# SUPERSEDES T-2831's regenerable-vs-content split for governance paths.
# T-2831 refused `.tasks/**`, `.context/project/decisions.yaml` and
# `.context/working/feedback-stream.yaml` UNCONDITIONALLY on the theory that
# they were irreplaceable content. Under T-2822 that theory is wrong for the
# worktree copy specifically -- the authoritative copy is on master and is
# untouched by this removal. What T-2831 was actually protecting -- "never
# silently discard uncommitted work" -- survives intact below as the SOURCE
# class, which is still refused unconditionally, --force included.
#
# The prefix rule is deliberate here, where T-2831's exact-match allowlist was
# deliberate there: T-2831 needed narrowness because it was deciding whether a
# file was regenerable (a per-file property). T-3102 decides whether a file is
# authoritative in THIS working copy (a per-directory property -- the whole
# governance tree is non-authoritative in a worktree, uniformly).
#
# NOTE (T-3102 correction): this predicate no longer decides on its own whether
# dirt blocks removal -- see _wt_is_discardable_dirt below. It survives because
# the discard SUMMARY still distinguishes governance dirt (non-authoritative
# fork) from vendored/generated dirt (regenerable), and those are different
# sentences to say to an operator.

# _wt_is_discardable_dirt <relpath> -> 0 (true) when a dirty <relpath> inside a
# linked worktree can be discarded on removal without losing work.
#
# T-3102 CORRECTION. The first cut of this task classed only `.context/**` and
# `.tasks/**` as discardable. That basis was too narrow to be operational: the
# read-only dry run found all four live worktrees still refused, every one of
# them on a dirty `VERSION`, two of them also on `.agentic-framework/**` and
# `lib/ts/dist/**`. The fix removed governance dirt as a CAUSE of refusal and
# unblocked nothing.
#
# The right set already existed. `_wt_is_ignorable_path` (defined further down,
# for `fw worktree gc`) enumerates exactly "vendored, generated, or
# session-local churn" -- content that is not work. We REUSE it rather than
# restate it: a second copy of that pattern list is precisely the drift bug this
# task exists to fix. (Definition order is irrelevant -- the whole file is

# Two deltas, both deliberate:
#
#   + .tasks/*   is discardable HERE but is NOT added to
#                _wt_is_ignorable_path. gc calls that function for LANDING
#                decisions ("did this branch's work reach master?"), and there a
#                `.tasks/` file IS a deliverable -- sweeping it into gc's
#                ignorable set would let gc reclaim a branch whose only real
#                content was a task file. The dirt caller asks a different
#                question ("would discarding this working copy lose anything?"),
#                and under T-2822 the answer for `.tasks/` is no: master holds
#                the authoritative copy. TWO CALLERS, TWO CORRECT ANSWERS. Do
#                not "unify" them -- unifying them is the bug.
#
#   - .fabric/*  is ignorable for gc but is NOT discardable here. Sanity-checked
#                at T-3102 rather than assumed: `fw fabric scan` SKIPS cards that
#                already exist (agents/fabric/lib/register.sh:203,331) -- it only
#                creates missing ones. So a MODIFIED card is not regenerable, and
#                cards carry hand-authored prose (`purpose:`, `standalone_reason:`
#                citing task ids). Discarding a dirty card would silently destroy
#                that. It stays ignorable for gc, where the question is "is a
#                changed card a deliverable?" (no), but blocking here, where the
#                question is "would discarding it lose content?" (yes). None of
#                the four live worktrees carries `.fabric/` dirt, so excluding it
#                costs nothing operationally and keeps the guard honest.
#
# The other classes WERE checked, not assumed:
#   .context/*            non-authoritative fork; master is the authority (T-2822)
#   .agentic-framework/*  vendored copy of this repo's own source, rewritten
#                         wholesale by `fw vendor self` (bin/fw:_self_vendor)
#   VERSION               derived from FW_VERSION in bin/fw, restamped by
