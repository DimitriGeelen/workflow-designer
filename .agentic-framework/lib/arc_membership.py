"""Canonical Python helper for arc-membership scans.

T-1880 (T-NEW-15, arc-grooming): consolidates the union-of-`arc_id:`-frontmatter
plus legacy `arc:<slug>`-tag scan that previously lived inline in three
Watchtower blueprints (web/blueprints/arcs.py, core.py, tasks.py).

Origin: silent-corpus #1 (T-1874/75/76/77) and #2 (T-1879) showed that
each consumer re-implemented the scan, so a storage-format migration
(T-1850: `tags:[arc:X]` → `arc_id: X`, 162 tasks) left every inline
reader returning zero for migrated arcs. Captured as L-397.

Public API:
  scan_tasks_by_arc_membership(project_root)
      → (by_arc_id: dict[str, list[task_id]],
         by_tag:    dict[str, list[task_id]])
      Frontmatter-only, read to the closing `---` (T-3502; was a fixed
      1KB budget that silently undercounted 17 of 29 arcs). Returns BOTH
      indices so callers that want a strict-canonical view (arc_id only)
      can use by_arc_id alone, while callers that want backward-
      compatibility can union both.

  scan_tasks_by_arc_id(project_root)
      → dict[str, list[repo_relative_path]]
      arc_id_value → [path,...]. Used by audit's stale-arc check which
      needs file paths (for `git log -- <path>`), not task ids.

  task_has_arc_membership(task_file_path)
      → bool
      Single-task frontmatter check — true if either arc_id: is set OR
      a tags: line contains arc:<slug>.

All functions are pure (no caching) — Watchtower request-cached wrappers
live in web/blueprints/arcs.py (`_arc_membership()`, `_arc_tasks_by_id()`).

# T-3502: hard cap only, NOT a read budget. Frontmatter is delimited, so it is
# read to its terminator; this exists solely to stop a runaway or binary file
# being slurped. Real frontmatter in this corpus is under 3 KB, so 64 KB is two
# orders of margin: hitting it means the file is malformed, and that is reported
# rather than silently truncated.
#
# WHAT THIS REPLACED, AND WHY IT WAS NOT A BUG WHEN WRITTEN. The previous
# `_HEAD_READ_BYTES = 1024` was justified in its own comment as "enough to
# capture them on every task file in the corpus (largest frontmatter observed is
# ~700 bytes)… 1841 task files". Both figures were TRUE when measured and are now
# false: the corpus is ~3,500 files, and the task template has since grown a
# ~25-line arc_id/demo_target/BVP comment block plus `bvp_scores_proposed:` and
# `cost_estimate_proposed:` blocks, which push real fields past byte 1024.
#
# Measured before the change, frontmatter-only, truncated vs full: 56 membership
# markers lived beyond byte 1024, **17 of 29 arcs were undercounted**, 59 members
# were invisible. Worse than a miss, truncation landed MID-TOKEN, so
# T-1655 ("G-062 mechanism 1: codify arc completion") read as
# `arc_id: orchestrator-reth` — dropping it from `orchestrator-rethink` AND
# fabricating a phantom arc with one member. Reported by cashweb-integration-agent
# (agent-chat-arc @1247); quantified under T-3501.
#
# This is the T-3326 mutable-corpus-anchor class living in a CONSTANT rather than
# a test: a correctly-measured assumption that the corpus outgrew, with nothing
# watching for the drift. The governing rule, now applied here: **a bounded read
# of an unbounded field must report that it was bounded.** Same discipline as
# `blast_radius` unknown-not-zero (T-3068) and the BVP ledger's
# `attributable: false` with token fields absent — a reader that stops early
# cannot distinguish "no value" from "a value I never reached".
