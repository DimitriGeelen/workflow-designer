# handover-lock.sh — the budget-critical auto-handover's re-entry lock (T-3917, G-110).
#
# checkpoint.sh (T-136) holds .context/working/.handover-in-progress while it runs
# the auto-handover, so a second PostToolUse call does not start a second one.
# Before T-3917 the lock was the literal "1", removed only on the normal path:
# any kill mid-handover (the claude-fw terminator's SIGTERM, a hook timeout)
# stranded it, and every later auto-handover was skipped SILENTLY — measured
# stale for ~4 months on AEF's own host and ~163 days on ring20-manager's.
#
# Now the lock records "<epoch> <pid>", and ONE predicate decides staleness for
# both the writer (checkpoint.sh) and the reporter (fw doctor):
#   - the writer's PID is no longer running, or
#   - the lock is older than 2 x FW_HANDOVER_TOTAL_TIMEOUT (floor 300 s), or
#   - it is a legacy lock (no epoch/pid) — judged by its file age alone.
#
# Usage:
#   source "$FRAMEWORK_ROOT/lib/handover-lock.sh"
#   fw_handover_lock_write "$lock"
#   if why=$(fw_handover_lock_stale "$lock"); then ... "$why" ...; fi
