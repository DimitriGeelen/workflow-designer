# and what degrades is the loudest line in the output. Source it here too, next

# T-2095 (T-2078 V1-D, F2): self-vendor extraction.
#
# Refreshes the framework's own .agentic-framework/lib/ from FRAMEWORK_ROOT/lib/.
# Origin: T-1217 — without this, new lib/*.sh files (e.g., watchtower.sh from
# T-1154) go stale in the vendored copy, causing pre-push audit errors for the
# framework repo itself.
#
# Was inlined in do_upgrade body until T-2095 — extracted so it can be invoked
# explicitly via `fw vendor self` (cron / pre-push / manual) AND opted out of
# do_upgrade via `--no-self-vendor` (operators who have wired pre-push and don't
# want the inline redundancy).
#
# Structural consumer-safety: the function early-returns when
# $FRAMEWORK_ROOT/.agentic-framework/lib does not exist — this is the case for
# any consumer's vendored copy (no nested .agentic-framework/lib/). T-1217's
# guard is preserved unchanged; the extraction is pure refactor.
#
# Args:
#   $1 — dry_run flag ("true" / "false"). When "true", reports what would
#        be synced without copying files.
# Return:
#   0 — sync completed (or nothing to sync, or consumer-skip)
# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
# T-3165 (arc-012): the concurrent-session withholding guard.
#
# THE PROBLEM. The T-2240 pre-push gate refuses a push when a vendored-class file
# is stale in the COMMITTED tree, and prescribes `fw vendor self` as the fix. That
# command syncs every vendored class from the WORKING tree — including files a
# concurrent task has uncommitted. So the remedy for my drift silently stages
# someone else's unfinished work into `.agentic-framework/`, which is exactly
# where consumers pull from. Third occurrence in three consecutive sessions.
#
# It is a false-green of the usual family: the signal that would reveal the
# problem — a stale-vendor warning — has just been cleared by the command that
# caused it. Nothing objects, and the agent only avoids it by already knowing
# which files belong to another task. Nothing surfaces that list.
#
# THE RULE. A source file that differs from HEAD is by construction not yet
# committed, so vendoring it ships uncommitted work across a trust boundary.
# Real runs therefore withhold dirty vendored-class files by default. The caller
# names their own via FW_VENDOR_ONLY so the push gate can still be cleared
# normally, and FW_VENDOR_ALL=1 restores the old sweep as a logged, explicit act.
#
# DRY-RUN AND --check ARE DELIBERATELY NOT GUARDED. They are drift DETECTORS, and
# a detector that hides drift because the file is dirty is the very blindness this
# guard exists to prevent (T-3165 AC4). They report what is truly out of sync;
# only the mutating path withholds.

# T-2793 (OBS-151): self-vendor the VERSION file. Seventh sibling of
# _self_vendor_libs / _templates / _policy / _shim / _agents / _web.
#
# Why it was missing and why that matters more now. `fw vendor self` synced six
# classes of CONTENT and never the copy's identity, so .agentic-framework/VERSION
# held whatever the last full `do_vendor` wrote — measured at 1.6.234 against a
# source at 1.6.114, a number from a different era. Anything comparing the two
# (fw_version_relation, doctor's pinned-vs-installed, consumer-recovery ordering)
# was reasoning about a version nothing had ever run.
#
# It stops being cosmetic once the CLI is vendored (T-2793): a vendored copy has
# no .git, so _derive_version falls through to this file, and VERSION becomes the
# ONLY statement of which framework a consumer is running.
#
# SYNC-ONLY — bin/fw calls this outside the --check set, and that asymmetry is the
# whole design. The VERSION file is rewritten in the working tree on every commit
# (it carries the git-derived major.minor.commits-since-tag; measured 1.6.114 ->
# 1.6.120 across six commits in one session). A checked class would therefore go
# red again the moment you commit the sync that cleared it — the T-2240 pre-push
# gate refuses, `fw vendor self` fixes it, the commit re-breaks it. A gate that
# cannot be satisfied is worse than one that does not fire.
#
# Stated plainly because it IS the unwitnessable-check shape (T-2726): a sync with
# no verifier. Accepted here only because the drift is guaranteed rather than
# occasional, harmless between vendor runs, and cleared by every mutating run. If
# VERSION ever stops moving per commit, this belongs back inside --check.
#
# (An earlier revision of this comment claimed VERSION "moves only at release" and
# used that to justify checking it. That was wrong — the per-commit rewrite was
# observed immediately afterwards. Left recorded rather than deleted: the claim
# was load-bearing for the design and the correction is the reason it changed.)

# T-3150 — project-owned regions in a consumer's CLAUDE.md
# ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
#
# Step [1/10] rebuilds a consumer's CLAUDE.md as (consumer header) + (framework
# governance). The previous form was `sed -n '1,/^## Core Principle$/{ /^## Core Principle$/d; p; }'`
# applied to the consumer file: what survived an upgrade was whatever happened
# to sit ABOVE the line `## Core Principle`. That is a content-shaped contract —
# a consumer that organised its governance coherently, putting its own
# completion rules next to the framework's completion rules and therefore BELOW
# that heading, lost them silently on every upgrade. Observed three times in one
# upgrade of a live consumer.
#
# The markers below make survival DECLARED rather than inferred from position:
#
#     <!-- project-owned: begin -->
#     ...anything...
#     <!-- project-owned: end -->
#
# Semantics (see T-3150):
#   1. At least one well-formed region  => rebuilt file is
#      header + framework governance + every region in file order, verbatim,
#      INCLUDING the marker lines (that is what makes the next upgrade find
#      them again).
#   2. ALL regions survive — not just the first.
#   3. A region that already sits above `## Core Principle` is in the header
#      already; it is de-duplicated by content so a second upgrade is a no-op.
#   4. No markers => byte-identical behaviour to the positional path.
#   5. An unmatched marker REFUSES the rewrite. Guessing at to-EOF, or falling
#      through to the positional path, would destroy the content the operator
#      was marking in order to protect.

# Report unmatched project-owned markers in $1. Prints one human-readable line
# per problem (empty output = well-formed) and always exits 0; the caller
# decides what an unmatched marker means.

# T-3113 (R7 leg L4): post-upgrade linked-worktree staleness advisory.
#
# `fw upgrade` refreshed the main checkout. Every linked worktree beside it is
# still running whatever enforcement code it forked with — and before this
# helper existed, `grep -c worktree lib/upgrade.sh` returned 0. The command that
# exists to propagate the framework was blind to the replicas of it.
#
# This is the LOUD half of R7. Vendored propagation is pull-only: no leg reaches
# a project that never upgrades, so the moment it does upgrade is the last moment
# available to say anything at all. L3 (T-3112) put the same information in
# `fw doctor`; this puts it where the operator is already thinking about
# staleness, with "what just changed" still warm.
#
# TWO FACTS, BOTH REPORTED. Either alone misleads:
#   - commits behind the authority's HEAD — tracked content (bin/fw, lib/, hooks
#     templates). A worktree 2000 commits behind runs 2000-commit-old enforcement.
#   - hook delta vs the authority's .claude/settings.json — NOT the same question.
#     `.claude/settings.json` drifts independently of commit distance; a worktree
#     can be 0 behind and still missing four hooks (measured: t100196-vendor-fix).
# Reporting only one produces a confident green that the other would have refuted.
#
# The hook half delegates to fw_hook_parity_delta (lib/hook-parity.sh, T-3112).
# lib/upgrade.sh holds no copy of the predicate; a bats test pins that.
#
# Non-blocking by spec, same contract as _t2094_emit_doctor_advisory above:
# always returns 0. An advisory that can fail an upgrade is an advisory operators
# learn to route around.
#
# Extracted as a helper so bats can exercise it directly without driving a
# ten-step do_upgrade — same reason _t2094 was extracted.

#   $1 — target_dir (the project that was just upgraded)
