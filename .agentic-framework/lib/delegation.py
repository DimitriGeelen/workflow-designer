"""Reviewer-closeable delegation — criterion classifier and corpus surface (T-3445).

Mechanism for D-626 (operator ruling 2026-09-23, verbatim: *"if it is not high
risk, agent can use the reviewer agent which is critical for review and with a
positive outcome close it"*).

The ruling already existed; nothing reached it. Every deterministic Human
criterion in this corpus is written `[REVIEW]`, `[REVIEW]` means "human only",
so the delegation the operator granted classified zero criteria as delegable
(832's measurement over 342 open criteria: REVIEWER-CLOSEABLE 0, OPERATOR-ONLY
212). This module is the missing predicate: it says, per criterion, whether the
agent may take it.

WHAT THIS IS NOT. It does not change what the reviewer checks, and it does not
weaken a risk class. Three classes stay human — always, with no bypass flag in
this module: tier0-or-bypass, act-in-the-world, sovereignty-field.

T-3557 (GO 2026-09-30, IW-1/IW-5) changed the tie-break: "deterministic" is no
longer the delegation test. render-surface, taste, inception-decision and
unclassified route to REVIEWER-JUDGES — an independent agent reviewer judges
them and may escalate to the human. This module only ROUTES and REPORTS; it
never ticks or closes a criterion because of that bucket (T-3579, T-3580).

REUSE, NOT REBUILD. The vocabularies are imported from the reviewer's own
detectors so there is exactly one definition of each:

  * `_HUMAN_AC_TASTE_RE`      — T-1947 prose vocabulary  → class `taste`
  * `_HUMAN_AC_MECHANICAL_RE` — T-1896/T-1897 grep-able  → class `deterministic`
  * `_HUMAN_AC_STRATEGIC_RE`  — decide/approve/sign-off  → suppresses deterministic
  * `_AGENT_AS_SUBJECT_RE` + `_HUMAN_SUBJECT_RE` + `_AUDIENCE_OPT_OUT_RE`
                              — T-2147 audience axis     → class `agent-self`
  * `RENDER_SURFACE_PATTERNS` — read out of lib/render_surface.sh (T-1766), the
                                single source of truth its own header insists on

The deterministic gate is deliberately the SAME shape as
`static_scan.detect_human_ac_mechanical_signal`: strategic-free title,
taste-free title, an `**Expected:**` clause that exists, is taste-free, and
carries a mechanical signal. A criterion with no Expected clause is not
deterministic — it is `unclassified`, and unclassified is human.
