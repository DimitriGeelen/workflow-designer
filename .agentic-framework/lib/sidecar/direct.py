"""arc-011 sidecar — direct (receiver-to-receiver) send path and sender ledger.

T-3693 (arc-011 slice 1, finishing T-3561). The design (D-645 §2) is one verb:
call the peer's receiver API. This module is that call, plus the sender-side
ledger that records what happened to each message, each state written by the
party that can know it:

    SENT          us, before the call
    RECEIVED      us, from the receiver's HTTP response (CONFIRM-1)
    HANDED_OVER   our receiver, when the peer's receiver posts CONFIRM-2 — which
                  the peer's prompt hook sends only after it surfaced the
                  message to the peer agent
    REPLIED       our receiver, when a message answering this one is stored
    UNDELIVERABLE us, when the receiver is down and the retry budget is spent
    REJECTED      us, from a 401 (bad token) or 409 (id reused with other content)
    ESCALATED     infrastructure (`fw sidecar sweep`), when HANDED_OVER has not
                  arrived by the message's deadline

Ledger: .context/sidecar/direct-ack.jsonl (append-only; latest row per id wins).
It is separate from the hub path's awaiting-ack.jsonl on purpose: that ledger's
three-state machine and retry ladder (T-3434) are the hub fallback's and are
left untouched.

Every non-success outcome is also appended to .context/sidecar/refusals.jsonl,
recorded for the T-3555 refusal ledger, which has not shipped.
