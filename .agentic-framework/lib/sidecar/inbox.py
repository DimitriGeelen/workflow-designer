"""arc-011 sidecar — inbox: consults addressed to this agent.

T-3406, slice 4. Slices 1-3 could send; nothing could read. This is the
receiving half, and the two decisions in it are both forced by measurements
from earlier slices rather than chosen freely:

**Why we keep our own cursor instead of `channel subscribe --resume`.**
TermLink's persisted cursor lives in `~/.termlink/cursors.json` keyed by
`(topic, identity)`, and the identity is machine-wide — measured in T-3405,
where this project and 832-Workflow-designer both post under fingerprint
`d1993c2c3ec44c94`. Two AEF projects on one host would therefore share and
clobber one cursor. Ours is per-project state under `.context/sidecar/`.

**Why we dedupe on `client_msg_id` here at all.** The hub's own dedupe is
TTL-bounded — measured at ~5 minutes in T-3405, where a re-post at +15m39s
appended a duplicate. So a sender retrying on any deadline longer than that
TTL delivers twice, and only the receiver can collapse it. Slice 3 put the
id into envelope metadata precisely so this side has something to key on.
This does NOT decide OBS-447's open question (bound the retry window vs.
receiver-side dedupe) — receiver-side dedupe is required under either
answer, so building it prejudges nothing.
