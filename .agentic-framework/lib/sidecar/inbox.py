"""arc-011 sidecar — inbox: consults addressed to this agent.

T-3406, slice 4. Slices 1-3 could send; nothing could read. This is the
receiving half, and the two decisions in it are both forced by measurements
from earlier slices rather than chosen freely:

**Why we keep our own cursor instead of `channel subscribe --resume`.**
TermLink's persisted cursor lives in `~/.termlink/cursors.json` keyed by
`(topic, identity)`, and the identity is machine-wide — measured in T-3405,
where this project and 832-Workflow-designer both post under fingerprint
`d1993c2c3ec44c94`. Two AEF projects on one host would therefore share and
clobber one cursor. Ours is per-project state under `.context/sidecar/`.

**Why we dedupe on `client_msg_id` here at all.** The hub's own dedupe is
TTL-bounded — measured at ~5 minutes in T-3405, where a re-post at +15m39s
appended a duplicate. So a sender retrying on any deadline longer than that
TTL delivers twice, and only the receiver can collapse it. Slice 3 put the
id into envelope metadata precisely so this side has something to key on.
This does NOT decide OBS-447's open question (bound the retry window vs.
receiver-side dedupe) — receiver-side dedupe is required under either
answer, so building it prejudges nothing.

    them. `pending()` was widened to drain circuit + legacy; `retry.
    answered_conversations()` was not, and kept peeking the circuit topic
    alone.

    The consequence was not a missing message — `pending()` still surfaced
    everything — it was that the SWEEP could not see a reply. A peer answering
    on the legacy rail left the ack-ledger row open, so every five minutes the
    retry ladder re-posted, nudged, and eventually fired an operator notice
    for a conversation that had been answered days earlier. Measured
    2026-09-25: the circuit topic held 0 foreign conversations and the legacy
    topic held 8, including all three that had climbed to rung 5.

    every reader follows. Adding a topic at a call site is the bug.

    T-3479 is that future address change, and this is the whole of its read
    half: the V9 topic joins the list here, and `pending()` plus
    `retry.answered_conversations()` both follow without being touched. That
    the widening is a one-line change in one place is the property T-3462 built

    T-3544 / OBS-567. Sibling of `dm.summary()` — same job on the rail peers
    are actually told to use — and the reason it exists is that until it did,
    nothing counted this. `fw audit` watched the OUTBOUND ledger, `fw doctor`
    watched `dm:*`, and an arriving consult was visible only to someone who
    chose to run `fw sidecar inbox` with no reason to think there was anything
    to read. 832 waited six days that way; 010-termlink found 49 of ours doing
    the same on their side.

    **This must not drain what it measures.** `pending()` moves cursors and
    the shared seen-set by default, so counting the naive way would consume
    the consult it was reporting — the OBS-566/T-3539 shape where the
    diagnostic destroys its own subject. The read here is `advance=False`,
    which touches no file; `tests/unit/test_sidecar_unread_summary.py` pins
    that by byte-comparing `inbox-state.json` across a call, with a control
    leg that fails against an advancing read.

    **Why this counts through `pending()` rather than offsets-minus-cursor.**
    The cheap arithmetic `dm._unread_count` uses is right for a DM rail, whose
    cursor is the whole story. A consult inbox additionally dedupes on
    `client_msg_id` across three alias topics, so records-past-cursor
    overstates owed work — measured here at 5 records versus 1 actual consult.
    Draining through the same function `fw sidecar inbox` uses means the number
    the WARN reports is exactly the number of consults the operator will be
    shown when they act on it. An alarm and its remedy that disagree teach
    people to distrust the alarm.
