"""arc-011 sidecar — real TermLink transport and hub capability probe.

T-3405 (T-3397 Amendment 5, slice 3). Slices 1 and 2 built the outbox and the
delivery leg against injected fakes; this supplies the real implementations of
both seams.

**Transport.** Maps onto TermLink's own primitives rather than reinventing
them: `termlink channel post <topic> [--hub <addr>] --client-msg-id <id>`.
`--hub` present-or-absent IS the uniform path (Amendment 5), and
`--client-msg-id` is natively the dedupe primitive Amendment 5 said to reuse,
so a caller-owned retry is idempotent on TermLink's side rather than on ours.

**Probe — why it refuses more than it accepts.** TermLink's CLI grades hub
trust in rungs that do not imply each other, which is the whole point of
T-2415 (their measurement of a fleet that was "reachable + authenticating +
version-floor-exempt + structurally incapable, all at once"):

    termlink hub probe <addr>   TLS handshake, no auth   -> reachable
    termlink remote ping <hub>  needs a 32-byte secret   -> authenticating
    (no unauthenticated call)                            -> version: UNKNOWN

Amendment 5 makes the per-hub capability + version-floor check an acceptance
gate rather than a follow-up, so a hub whose version cannot be established is
**refused** — and the refusal says *version floor unestablished*, never
"unreachable", because collapsing those two is how a reachable-but-incapable
hub gets treated as a valid send target. The local hub (`hub: None`, the
degenerate case) can clear every rung, so it is the one that passes today.

    only `inbox:*`/`dm:*` as mail. `to` decides which form
    (lib/sidecar/circuit.py owns the derivation, and is the only place that
    does): a bare project id resolves to the durable role address, a bare
    agent name to an agent under our project, and a `to` that already

    heuristic when a caller knows better than `is_project_id` can.
