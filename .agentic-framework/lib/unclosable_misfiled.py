"""owner:human tasks with no real Human criteria have no route to closure (T-3449).

THE CLASS. A task that is `owner: human`, carries **no real `### Human`
criterion** (only the template's commented-out example, if anything), and has
**every `### Agent` criterion ticked** cannot close through any existing verb:

  * `fw task delegate` (D-626, T-3445) converts *deterministic Human
    criteria*. These have none to convert — it measures "0 open Human
    criterion/criteria … converted 0, left human 0, owner: human (unchanged)"
    and stops there.
  * An agent cannot close a human-owned task directly (CLAUDE.md
    §Human Task Completion Rule, §Autonomous Mode Boundaries) — that would be
    completing work the human owns, not delegation.
  * `fw review-queue` and `/approvals` only surface tasks with an OPEN Human
    criterion (`web.shared.count_unchecked_human_acs`); a task with zero real
    Human criteria has nothing open by that predicate, so it is invisible
    everywhere except CTL-029's general "completable but not closed" count,
    indistinguishable there from the ordinary agent-owned abandoned case.

THE PARSE THAT MATTERS. The task template ships a `### Human` heading whose
entire body is an HTML comment carrying a worked `[REVIEW]` example. A naive
scan of `- [ ]` / `- [x]` lines under `### Human` counts that example as a
real criterion — the exact false positive that made two ad-hoc measurements
of this class disagree during discovery. This module counts zero for that
task because the Human scan is comment-stripped before counting.

A SECOND, SHARPER PARSE BUG, FOUND WHILE VERIFYING THIS ONE. The obvious
building block — `lib.delegation.parse_criteria`, which scopes to the body of
`## Acceptance Criteria` (first-wins, bounded at the next `## ` heading,
T-3148) — undercounts Human criteria the T-3029/T-2420 way: a `### Human`
heading placed after an intervening `## ` heading (e.g. a stray
`## Status: COMPLETED …`) falls outside that bound and is invisible to it.
Measured live on T-2200: a genuine, unticked `[REVIEW]` Human criterion sits
behind exactly such an intervening heading, and `lib.delegation.human_criteria`
reports zero — which would have put T-2200 in this class and recommended a
one-command close over a real unanswered criterion. `update-task.sh`'s own
close gate already refuses this shape for the opposite reason (T-3029:
"`### Human` heading found but positioned outside `## Acceptance Criteria`"),
so treating it as zero here would not just be wrong, it would recommend an
action the close gate does not even allow un-bypassed.

The Human side of this predicate therefore does NOT use
`lib.delegation.parse_criteria`. It uses its own `count_human_acs_total`
(below), sibling in ALGORITHM to `web.shared.count_unchecked_human_acs`
(T-3139) — same whole-document scope, same comment strip — but a SEPARATE
function living only here, not imported from `web/shared.py`. That is a
deliberate placement choice, not laziness: `web/shared.py` is a declared
render surface (`lib/render_surface.sh:RENDER_SURFACE_PATTERNS`, P-013/T-1766),
so ANY change to that file — even a pure backend helper nothing renders —
trips the render-surface gate and demands a `[REVIEW]` Human AC on whatever
task touches it. This predicate module has no rendering surface of its own,
so it stays out of that file entirely, at the cost of one small duplicated
function. `web.shared.count_unchecked_human_acs` itself has the identical
suffix-intolerance gap this function fixes locally (see OBS-256 in
`.context/concerns.yaml`) — left unfixed there deliberately, a separate task
per CLAUDE.md "one bug, one task", not a placement it inherits.

The Agent side has no equivalent hazard — `### Agent` is always the first
subhead directly under `## Acceptance Criteria` in every task this corpus
has, and `update-task.sh`'s own P-010 gate extracts it the same
AC-section-bounded way — so `lib.delegation.parse_criteria` /
`agent_criteria` (T-3445) is reused as-is, matching the close gate's own
ground truth for "all Agent ACs ticked" rather than re-deriving it.
