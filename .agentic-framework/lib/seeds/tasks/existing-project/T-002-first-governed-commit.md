# T-002: First governed commit for __PROJECT_NAME__

## Context

Make any small change and commit it through the framework. The commit-msg hook will validate the task reference. This proves the governance loop works end to end.

**Note:** Do not add `.context/` or `.tasks/` to `.gitignore` — these are managed by the framework and may need to be committed (e.g., handovers). Safe changes: fix a typo in README, add a code comment, or add build artifacts to `.gitignore`.

## Acceptance Criteria

### Agent
- [ ] Make a small, safe change to __PROJECT_NAME__ (typo fix, comment, .gitignore)
- [ ] Commit using `fw git commit -m "T-002: description"`
- [ ] Commit succeeds (hook validates T-002 reference)

## Verification

# Last commit references this task
git log -1 --format=%s | grep -q "T-002"
