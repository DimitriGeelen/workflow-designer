# T-002: First governed commit for __PROJECT_NAME__

## Context

Make any small change and commit it through the framework. The commit-msg hook will validate the task reference. This proves the governance loop works end to end.

**Note:** Do not add `.context/` or `.tasks/` to `.gitignore` — these are managed by the framework and may need to be committed (e.g., handovers). Safe changes: fix a typo in README, add a code comment, or add build artifacts to `.gitignore`.

## For the Operator

**What is happening:** the agent makes a deliberately small, safe change to
__PROJECT_NAME__ and commits it through the framework's git hooks. Small on purpose — the
point is to exercise the path, not to change anything you care about.

**Why it matters to you:** note the message format, `T-002: description`. That prefix is
enforced; a hook refuses commits without it. From here on, `git log` answers *why does this
line exist* by pointing at a task file that still holds the reasoning, the acceptance
criteria, and the decisions. On an existing codebase you will have two eras in your
history — before and after this commit. Only the second one is self-explaining.

**What you can do meanwhile:** nothing required. If the agent proposes a change you would
rather it not touch, say so — "small and safe" is its judgement, and yours overrides.

**Go deeper:** `fw corpus explain aef-task-lifecycle` — the states a task moves through, and
which gates guard each transition.

## Acceptance Criteria

### Agent
- [ ] Make a small, safe change to __PROJECT_NAME__ (typo fix, comment, .gitignore)
- [ ] Commit using `fw git commit -m "T-002: description"`
- [ ] Commit succeeds (hook validates T-002 reference)

## Verification

# Some commit in history references this task.
#
# NOT `git log -1 --format=%s` alone (T-2996 / G-006): that asserts a property
# of HEAD, true the moment this task completes and false from the very next
# commit onward -- a permanently-red CTL-013 in every project built on AEF,
# clearable by nothing, because the work it checks is correct and the question
# is wrong.
#
# NO PIPE AT ALL, deliberately (L-387 + T-2743). The obvious repair is
# `out=$(git log --format=%s); echo "$out" | grep -q "T-XXX"`, and it is still
# wrong: that form is SIGPIPE-free only while the capture fits the 65536-byte
# pipe buffer. This framework's own log is 608KB, and the repaired line exited
# 141 under P-011 on the first run. A fresh consumer would not hit it; a mature
# one would -- which is the same "goes red later" shape as the original defect.
#
# `git log --grep` filters inside git, so nothing is piped and nothing can
# SIGPIPE, at any history length. `-1` bounds git's own output AFTER filtering,
# so this is still a search over all history, not a check on HEAD.
# ANCHORED, and the subject compared explicitly (T-2999). `git log --grep`
# searches the whole commit MESSAGE, subject and body -- so an unanchored
# pattern passes on any commit that merely mentions this task id in its body,
# and --format then prints THAT commit's subject, which belongs to someone
# else. Observed in a consumer repo: --grep=T-003 selected
# "T-016: close onboarding gate, complete T-013, add T-015".
#
# The property both halves of this line mean is "a commit whose SUBJECT is this
# task". A bare -n test cannot express it: it only asks whether anything
# printed at all.
s=$(git log --grep='^T-002:' -1 --format=%s); [ "${s%%:*}" = "T-002" ]
