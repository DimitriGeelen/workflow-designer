# T-001: Orientation — understand __PROJECT_NAME__ and verify framework health

## Context

First task after `fw init`. Read existing project files, understand what __PROJECT_NAME__ does, and verify the framework is healthy.

## Acceptance Criteria

### Agent
- [ ] Read README and understand project purpose, tech stack, entry points
- [ ] Run `fw doctor` — all checks pass
- [ ] Run `fw audit` — note current pass/warn/fail counts as baseline
- [ ] Install git hooks: `fw git install-hooks`

## Verification

fw doctor
# fw audit exits 1 for warnings (expected on fresh projects) — only block on exit 2 (failures)
fw audit; test $? -le 1

## Updates

### __DATE__ — task-created [fw-init]
- **Action:** Auto-created by `fw init` (existing-project onboarding)
