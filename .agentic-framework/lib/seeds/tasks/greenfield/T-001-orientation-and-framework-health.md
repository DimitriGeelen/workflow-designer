# T-001: Orientation — explore framework and verify health for __PROJECT_NAME__

## Context

First task for __PROJECT_NAME__. Read CLAUDE.md to understand the framework, verify installation, and prepare for project definition.

## Acceptance Criteria

### Agent
- [ ] Read CLAUDE.md — understand core principle, task system, enforcement tiers
- [ ] Run `fw doctor` — all checks pass
- [ ] Run `fw audit` — note current state
- [ ] Install git hooks: `fw git install-hooks`

## Verification

fw doctor
# fw audit exits 1 for warnings (expected on fresh projects) — only block on exit 2 (failures)
fw audit; test $? -le 1

## Updates

### __DATE__ — task-created [fw-init]
- **Action:** Auto-created by `fw init` (greenfield onboarding)
