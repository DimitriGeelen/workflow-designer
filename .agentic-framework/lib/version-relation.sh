# T-2713 — one truthful answer to "is this consumer ahead or behind?".
#
# THE DEFECT THIS REPLACES
#
# Three sites open-coded the same comparison:
#
#     [ "$(printf '%s\n%s\n' "$a" "$b" | sort -V | tail -1)" = "$a" ] && ahead || behind
#
#   bin/fw:2015          doctor's consumer-fleet ahead/behind badge
#   lib/upgrade.sh:849   pre-step-1 runtime downgrade guard  (T-1912)
#   lib/upgrade.sh:1742  pin-rewrite downgrade guard         (T-1839)
#
# `sort -V` orders version STRINGS. VERSION here is a tag counter that RESETS —
# this repo's tags run v1.6.763, v1.6.762, v1.6.761, then v1.6.10, v1.6.9, and
# VERSION itself has gone 1.6.354 -> 1.6.121 -> 1.6.176. A counter that resets
# does not order, so every one of those three "ahead" verdicts is a guess wearing
# the costume of a comparison.
#
# The guards themselves are RIGHT (do not silently downgrade a consumer). They
# were simply handed an ordering that does not exist. Consequence in the field:
# a consumer pinned 1.6.264 reads "ahead" of a framework at 1.6.163, `fw upgrade`
# refuses to protect it, and it sits frozen for weeks — receiving no governance
# or security fixes — while wearing a bigger number.
#
# WHAT ORDERS INSTEAD
#
# Git ancestry, which cannot reset:
#   consumer commit is an ancestor of framework HEAD  -> genuinely BEHIND
#   framework HEAD is an ancestor of consumer commit  -> genuinely AHEAD
#   neither                                            -> DIVERGED
#
# For that we need the consumer's commit. Today the pin records only the counter,
# so `fw upgrade` now also records `version_sha:` (T-2713). Legacy pins have no
# sha; the version tag is tried next, and 31 tags exist for a counter in the
# hundreds, so most legacy pins resolve to neither. That case is UNDECIDABLE and
# is reported as such. It is NOT rendered as "ahead" — asserting a direction we
# cannot compute is what froze the consumer in the first place.
#
# This is T-2290's medicine (replace an untrustworthy proxy — there, file mtime —
# with the real object) applied to the same shape one layer up.
#
# Usage:
#   fw_version_relation <consumer_version> <framework_version> [consumer_sha] [framework_root]
#     sets:   FW_VERSION_RELATION         same | behind | ahead | diverged | undecidable
#     sets:   FW_VERSION_RELATION_REASON  one human-readable line
#     echoes: the relation (convenience only)
#
# CALL IT BARE, NOT IN `$(...)`. Command substitution forks a subshell, so the
# globals never reach the caller and every block message renders with an empty
# reason — a message that reports confidently about nothing. Correct:
#     fw_version_relation "$cv" "$fv" "$sha" "$root"
#     case "$FW_VERSION_RELATION" in ...

# Default for the undecidable case: 1 = proceed with a loud warning, 0 = refuse.
# Rationale in T-2713 §Decisions; this is the operator-reviewable knob.
