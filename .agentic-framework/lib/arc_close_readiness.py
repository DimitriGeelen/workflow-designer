"""Arc close-readiness: L1 + L2 + L3. T-3552 (T-3548 Slice A).

Operator ruling (2026-09-28), verbatim:

    "the threshold for Arc should not be 80%, it should be no high value, low
     cost, no high cost items left anymore" … "no unestimated tasks, point. And
     then no high value, no Q1, Q1 and Q2, quadrant 1 and quadrant 2 tasks left.
     And then we also talked about validating if the R goals are achieved."

    L1  no unestimated open member — every one carries a value AND a cost
    L2  no open member is high value — neither hv-lc (Q1) nor hv-hc (Q2) remains
    L3  the arc's goals are validated in the anchor's Recommendation + Rationale

WHAT THE 80% RATIO MEASURED
---------------------------
`completed / total` over constituents. That answers "how much of the list is
ticked", which is a property of the list, not of the work. An arc at 85% whose
remaining 15% is its entire high-value core surfaces as close-ready; an arc at 70%
whose remainder is all low-value polish does not. Both backwards, and neither
visible, because a ratio cannot say what kind of thing is left.

L1+L2 ask about the remainder instead: closure is a claim about what is LEFT, and
value is what decides whether leftovers matter.

THIS IS A SURFACING PREDICATE, NOT A GATE
-----------------------------------------
Nothing here permits a closure. `lib/arc.sh:arc_close()` has no ratio check and
gains none; `fw arc close` stays agent-refused under $CLAUDECODE (T-1671) and
operator-owned. What changes is which arcs the operator is shown, and what they
are told about why.

THE POPULATION IS NOT `fw bvp`'s, AND THAT IS DELIBERATE
--------------------------------------------------------
The quadrant FUNCTION is imported from `lib/bvp.sh` (via `bvp_py`), never
re-derived — one classifier, one implementation. But the POPULATION the medians
are computed over is different, and pretending otherwise would be the real defect:

    fw bvp        ranks "what should I work on next", and therefore EXCLUDES
                  work-completed (T-2223).
    this module   asks "what is LEFT in this arc", and therefore INCLUDES
                  work-completed tasks that are still in .tasks/active/ —
                  partial-complete, awaiting Human-criterion verification.

That is not a detail. 134 of 152 open arc members are partial-complete; on
`fw bvp`'s population they would have no quadrant at all, and L2 would pass every
arc by never looking at the tasks that make it up. Two populations, one honest
reason each, both named. A caller comparing this module's verdict against a
`fw bvp --quadrant hv-lc` listing will see differences, and they are these.

L3 IS SUPPLIED, NOT READ
------------------------
The anchor Recommendation lives behind a web blueprint helper
(`_anchor_recommendation`). Importing a blueprint into lib/ would invert the
dependency and drag Flask into `fw review-queue`, so the caller passes what it
already has. The leg is still evaluated here, so every surface applies the same
rule to it.
