"""lib/bvp_judge.py — judges a PROPOSED BVP score (T-3526, D-662 slice 2 of 3).

T-3524 GO. Producer-not-judge is restored here by separating PARTIES rather than
by putting the operator back in the approval path: `agents/termlink/bvp-estimator/
estimator.py` PROPOSES `bvp_scores_proposed:`; this module JUDGES that proposal.
Neither party writes `bvp_scores:` — that stays the human's door via `fw bvp confirm`
(T-1924), and the T-3523 sticky guard already protects a confirmed score from either
side re-writing it.

── IMPORTS THE CONTRACT, DEFINES NO SECOND ONE ──────────────────────────────────

This module imports `lib.judge_verdict` for every piece of verdict vocabulary
(green/amber/red/unknown, guidance-required, `may_proceed`, `reviewable`). It
defines no local state, no local `reviewable()`, no local guidance rule. See
`lib/judge_verdict.py`'s own docstring for why: arc membership in this repo
reached FIVE disagreeing implementations of one predicate before a full day went
into consolidating them into one file. Two judge agents (this one and T-3527's
arc-driver judge) each carrying their own idea of what amber means is that defect
pre-ordered.

── WHAT IT JUDGES AGAINST (operator ruling, D-662, IW-3) ────────────────────────

1. PRESENCE    — are acceptance/quality criteria on the task AT ALL?
2. SUFFICIENCY — are they substantive enough to justify the score claimed?
3. GOAL HIERARCHY — map the work to its objective at the right level: the task's
   own goal, the arc's, or the project's.

The operator's answer on (3) is what makes this buildable without waiting on
T-3410 (the estimator's own detector-quality follow-up): the yardstick is **the
goal hierarchy, which is written down** —

    - task level:    frontmatter `description:`, or the body `## Context` section
    - arc level:      the task's `arc_id:` resolved to `.context/arcs/<id>.yaml`'s
                      `description:` / `headline_mechanic:`
    - project level:  `policy/value-drivers.yaml`'s `protected_drivers:` (D1-D4),
                      which always exists as the last resort — the project's
                      objective is never unwritten, only sometimes the ONLY level
                      a task can be checked against, which is itself information

— not a rebuild of the estimator's own keyword detectors, which report no-signal
on 83% of 3,350 tasks (T-3408) and therefore cannot serve as a yardstick. This
module does not touch those detectors. T-3410 remains the estimator's own
follow-up; out of scope here, confirmed untouched by this task's diff.

── POPULATION: OPEN TASKS ONLY (D-662, IW-4) ────────────────────────────────────

`judge_task()` calls `judge_verdict.reviewable()` before doing anything else.
Closed work is never rescored — a closed task's score is the record of what was
decided at the time.

── READ-ONLY ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

This module never writes to a task file. It reads `bvp_scores_proposed:` (the
proposer's door) and never touches `bvp_scores:` (the human's door via `fw bvp
confirm`). There is no write path here to gate.
