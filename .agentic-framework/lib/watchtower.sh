# lib/watchtower.sh — Shared Watchtower URL detection and browser-open helper (T-974, T-1154)
#
# Centralizes port detection, host detection, and browser opening so that
# ALL scripts use the same logic. Eliminates hardcoded ports and duplicated
# browser-open code.
#
# Usage:
#   source "$FRAMEWORK_ROOT/lib/watchtower.sh"
#   url=$(_watchtower_url T-XXX)                    # get base URL with correct port
#   _watchtower_open "http://host:port/path"         # open in browser (desktop-user aware)
#
# Requires: PROJECT_ROOT (from paths.sh chain), config.sh for fw_config

# Source config for PORT setting (guard protects double-source)
source "${FRAMEWORK_ROOT:-.}/lib/config.sh"

# _watchtower_identity_matches URL
#
# Returns 0 iff the service at URL identifies (via /api/_identity) as THIS
# project's Watchtower: service=="watchtower" AND project_root==our root
# (PROJECT_ROOT, else FRAMEWORK_ROOT). Single source of truth for the identity
# handshake used by both the reader (_watchtower_url) and the writer
# (bin/watchtower.sh's port-kill guard + triple-write gate). T-1803.
# _watchtower_our_root
#
# T-3054: the single place the "which project are we?" answer is derived, and
# the only place the FRAMEWORK_ROOT fallback is allowed to fire. It prints the
# root on stdout and — when it fell back — a warning on stderr.
#
# The fallback existed in two places (bin/watchtower.sh's launch line and the
# identity check below) and was silent in both, which is what made it a false
# green: the check that exists to catch a wrong-project instance computed its
# expected value with the same expression the instance had used, so a
# misconfigured server matched itself and passed `fw doctor`. A guard whose
# predicate is derived from the thing it validates cannot fail.

# The fallback is kept, not removed — serving the framework repo itself is a
# legitimate run. It is now audible.

# _watchtower_base_or_placeholder [TASK_ID]
#
# T-2922. Same question as _watchtower_url — "what is this project's Watchtower
# base URL?" — for the callers that must keep going when the answer is "there
# isn't one running yet". _watchtower_url fails loud by design (Layer 3, exit 1,
# no stdout) so callers needing a LIVE server can detect it; under `set -e` a
# bare `x=$(_watchtower_url)` assignment aborts the caller outright. For
# emit_review that abort happened BEFORE the `.reviewed-<id>` marker write —
# the only unblock for `fw inception decide` — so on a fresh `fw init` project,
# where nothing has yet told the user to run `fw serve`, the first inception was
# uncompletable by any path.
#
# Answers on stdout in BOTH cases and distinguishes them by EXIT CODE, never by
# output shape:
#
#   0 — live and identity-verified (delegates to _watchtower_url verbatim)
#   2 — no Watchtower reachable. stdout is a WOULD-BE base URL: the port this
#       project's Watchtower comes back on, wrong to treat as reachable now.
#       Candidates are tried in order: the triple-file port (where it last ran,
#       and where a bare `fw watchtower restart` rebinds, T-2598), then the
#       configured port. A candidate that something is already listening on is
#       skipped. We only get here because nothing identified as ours, so any
#       holder is foreign, and naming its port would hand this project's review
#       links to another server (T-3379: after a reboot, links pointed at a
#       neighbour's Watchtower on :3000). If every candidate is held, the answer
#       is an RFC 2606 `.invalid` host, which can never resolve to anyone.
#
# Two distinct non-empty answers rather than "empty means down", because an
# empty base silently concatenates into "/review/T-XXX" — a broken relative path
# that looks like a link. A caller that ignores the exit code gets a URL that is
# merely premature; a caller that reads it gets the truth. (L-578: a check that
# can only answer yes/no cannot say which question it answered — so the third
# state gets its own code, not a sentinel value the caller may not notice.)
#
# This lives here, not in the callers, because lib/watchtower.sh is the single
# source of port resolution (T-974, T-1154) and T-1155's invariant suite pins
# that: `fw_config "PORT" 3000` inline in lib/review.sh or lib/verify-acs.sh is
