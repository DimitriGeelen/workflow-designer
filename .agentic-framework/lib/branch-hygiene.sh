#
# WARN-only branch hygiene scan. Prints one finding per line to stdout and
# prints NOTHING when the repo is tidy — callers (fw doctor) wrap findings in
# their own WARN formatting and count lines. Always exits 0: this is an
# advisory rail, never a gate.
#
# Judged against TARGET = origin/master when present, else master. Repos with
# no master lineage produce no findings (nothing to judge against).

#
# Origin: T-100139 inception measured 29 merged-but-undeleted branches and live
# strands 215-248 commits behind master, all invisible. C1 (T-100142) deletes
# branches on verified `fw integrate run` landings; this scan surfaces the
# remaining debris. FW_BRANCH_BEHIND_WARN is shared with C3 (T-100144).
#
# T-100195 (RCA T-100194): the behind-only reading could not distinguish a
# bidirectional fork (host ALSO ahead) from a pure lag — the exact state that
# made a go-live `git merge origin/master` explode into 100+ conflicts. The
# `diverged-fork` class separates the two so the WARN can name the right remedy.

# T-3094 (T-3093 slice 1): days since the last commit ON a ref, or "" if unknown.
# Staleness has to be measured on the branch, not on the target. The behind-count
# answers "how much happened elsewhere", which on this repo is ~41 commits/day and
# 88% governance churn — it crosses a 50-commit threshold in ~1.2 days and fires on
# every healthy branch. "Nobody has touched this in N days" is the question that
# actually separates a strand from work in progress. Same unit and default as
# FW_STALE_ARC_DAYS (T-1855).

    # Every finding class below asks "can this branch still be reconciled?".
    # None asks "is this the branch we are supposed to be on?". Those are
    # different questions, and the gap between them is measurable: the session
    # sat on `t2539-staging` for 41 days (cut 2026-07-16 for T-2539, which
    # closed 19 seconds later, then never left). It was 0 BEHIND master the
    # whole time — a clean fast-forward — so `diverged-fork` had no reason to
    # fire and every other class passed it silently. Being on the sanctioned
    # branch and being on some tidy wrong branch produced identical output.
    #
    # That is the false-green shape: a check that cannot see its subject
    # reports the same thing as a check that looked and was satisfied. The fix
    # is to name the expected branch, so the finding is about identity.
    #
    # Deliberately scoped three ways, because a guard that cries everywhere
    # gets muted and then it is worse than absent:
    #   1. Silent unless the repo HAS the dev branch. A consumer project on a
    #      master-only model never sees this class.
    #   2. Main checkout only. A linked worktree sits on a feature branch by
    #      design (§Worktree Policy), so firing there would flag correct work.
    #      Discriminator: --git-dir == --git-common-dir only in the main tree.
    #   3. Reports, never blocks. WARN is the right volume for a branch you may
    #      have switched to on purpose.
    #
    # `master` DOES fire: under the release train (§Release-Train Branch Model)
    # master is merge-only, so a session authoring there is as wrong as one on
    # a stale feature branch — and PROTECT_MASTER would block its first commit.

# ── T-100196 (Leg 2 of T-100195/T-100194): safe go-live routing ──
# Consumes the same ahead/behind classification as fw_branch_divergence and
# takes the SAFE action for the current checkout instead of leaving the
# operator to run a bare `git merge origin/master` (the T-100194 explosion:
# 100+ conflicts from a genuine bidirectional fork). This is the "lightweight
# fw go-live guard" recorded as defense-in-depth in T-100196's Decisions
# (mechanism (c) — session-on-master — is the primary fix; this guard covers
# the case where a branch drifts anyway).
#
# Routing (threshold shared with FW_BRANCH_BEHIND_WARN, default 50):
#   up to date (ahead=0 behind=0)         → report, no-op
#   ahead-only (ahead>0 behind=0)         → report, no-op (nothing to absorb)
#   diverged-fork (ahead>t AND behind>t)  → REFUSE. Never merges. Names the
#                                            reconcile-while-small remedy.
#   ff-clean (ahead=0 behind>0)           → safe fast-forward
#                                            (`git merge --ff-only`, cannot conflict)
#   nudge (0<ahead<=t, behind>t)          → advise landing the unique commits
#                                            via `fw integrate run` (one-way)
#                                            rather than merging origin/master in
#   minor (0<ahead<=t, 0<behind<=t)       → advise `fw sync` (rebase+push)
#
# Exit codes: 0 = no action needed / safely reconciled / advisory printed.
#             1 = refused (fork) or an attempted fast-forward failed.
#             2 = usage error (not a repo / no origin / no origin/master).
# ── T-3194: one name for the branch every remediation string must point at ──
# fw_branch_hygiene and fw_branch_divergence each resolve their own comparand
# (they prefer different refs, deliberately, and both are pinned by T-3188's
# tests — so this helper does NOT try to unify them). What it unifies is the
# far more error-prone half: the branch NAME that gets interpolated into advice
# printed by four different files. Before T-3194 those said `master` literally,
# which under the release train tells the operator to merge the older tree into
# the newer one — the advice actively undoing what the measurement just found.
#
# Echoes the dev branch when one exists locally or on origin, else `master`,
# which is the pre-T-3185 reading and keeps unsplit repos' output byte-identical.
