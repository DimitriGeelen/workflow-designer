#
# WARN-only branch hygiene scan. Prints one finding per line to stdout and
# prints NOTHING when the repo is tidy — callers (fw doctor) wrap findings in
# their own WARN formatting and count lines. Always exits 0: this is an
# advisory rail, never a gate.
#
# Judged against TARGET = the DEV branch — `origin/$FW_DEV_BRANCH` (default
# `bleeding-edge`) when present, then its local ref, and only then origin/master
# or master. T-3188. Under the release train (CLAUDE.md §Release-Train Branch
# Model) master lags deliberately, so judging landings against it would report
# every branch already landed on bleeding-edge as unlanded; the master legs
# remain solely for a master-only consumer that has no dev branch. Repos with
# neither lineage produce no findings (nothing to judge against).
#
# This header said "TARGET = origin/master" for as long as the code did not
# (T-3545 / OBS-467). Read the resolution chain in fw_branch_hygiene, not this
# comment, if the two ever disagree again — and see the parity test in
# tests/unit/t3545_branch_hygiene_header_parity.bats, which exists to stop them.

#
# Origin: T-100139 inception measured 29 merged-but-undeleted branches and live
# strands 215-248 commits behind master, all invisible. C1 (T-100142) deletes
# branches on verified `fw integrate run` landings; this scan surfaces the
# remaining debris. FW_BRANCH_BEHIND_WARN is shared with C3 (T-100144).
#
# T-100195 (RCA T-100194): the behind-only reading could not distinguish a
# bidirectional fork (host ALSO ahead) from a pure lag — the exact state that
# made a go-live `git merge origin/master` explode into 100+ conflicts. The
# `diverged-fork` class separates the two so the WARN can name the right remedy.

# T-3094 (T-3093 slice 1): days since the last commit ON a ref, or "" if unknown.
# Staleness has to be measured on the branch, not on the target. The behind-count
# answers "how much happened elsewhere", which on this repo is ~41 commits/day and
# 88% governance churn — it crosses a 50-commit threshold in ~1.2 days and fires on
# every healthy branch. "Nobody has touched this in N days" is the question that
# actually separates a strand from work in progress. Same unit and default as
# FW_STALE_ARC_DAYS (T-1855).

# T-3510 (OBS-547): resolve a branch name to its GOVERNING TASK's parked-ness.
#
# Parking is recorded in the TASK — `status: captured`, `horizon: later`, the
# Sovereign question written in the body — and nowhere in the branch. Every other
# rail in this file reads topology, and topology has no field for "deliberately
# unlanded", so `unmerged because it is not ready` and `unmerged because nobody
# got to it` are byte-identical to it.
#
# On 2026-09-26 that cost a sovereignty gate. This scan reported
# `t3487-remove-bvp-arc-approval-gate` as landable while T-3487 sat
# captured/horizon:later on an unanswered Sovereign question, the audit's
# mitigation line recommended `fw integrate run`, and a batch-merge worker did
# exactly that — taking the `fw arc close` identity gate off by default. No rule
# was broken; the rail simply could not express the distinction.
#
# Echoes "<task-id> <parked|live>", and NOTHING when the branch carries no
# resolvable task id. That silence is load-bearing, not laziness: a branch this
# helper cannot explain must fall through to its existing classification rather
# than be quietly exempted. Two of the four branches in that same merge —
# `dispatch-f25` and `dispatch-f21-f24` — carry no task id at all, so a helper
# that defaulted to "not parked" would read as coverage it does not have.
# T-3511: DELEGATES to lib/task-parked.sh. The body of this function used to live
# here (T-3510, one commit earlier); it moved the moment a second caller appeared —

# parked-ness read in two places with two implementations is how arc membership

    # closed 19 seconds later, then never left). It was 0 BEHIND master the
    # whole time — a clean fast-forward — so `diverged-fork` had no reason to
    # fire and every other class passed it silently. Being on the sanctioned
    # branch and being on some tidy wrong branch produced identical output.

    # That is the false-green shape: a check that cannot see its subject
    # reports the same thing as a check that looked and was satisfied. The fix
    # is to name the expected branch, so the finding is about identity.
    #
    # Deliberately scoped three ways, because a guard that cries everywhere
    # gets muted and then it is worse than absent:
    #   1. Silent unless the repo HAS the dev branch. A consumer project on a
    #      master-only model never sees this class.

    #      design (§Worktree Policy), so firing there would flag correct work.
    #      Discriminator: --git-dir == --git-common-dir only in the main tree.
    #   3. Reports, never blocks. WARN is the right volume for a branch you may
    #      have switched to on purpose.
    #
    # `master` DOES fire: under the release train (§Release-Train Branch Model)

# the case where a branch drifts anyway).
#
# Routing (threshold shared with FW_BRANCH_BEHIND_WARN, default 50):
#   up to date (ahead=0 behind=0)         → report, no-op
#   ahead-only (ahead>0 behind=0)         → report, no-op (nothing to absorb)

#   ff-clean (ahead=0 behind>0)           → safe fast-forward

#                                            via `fw integrate run` (one-way)
#                                            rather than merging the dev branch in
#   minor (0<ahead<=t, 0<behind<=t)       → advise `fw sync` (rebase+push)
