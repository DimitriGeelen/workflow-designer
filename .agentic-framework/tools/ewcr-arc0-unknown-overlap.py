"""EWCR Arc 0, falsifier 1 — do the Unknown-subsystem Fabric entries intersect
the runtime write set?

Roadmap §6 fence 1 ("Component Fabric non-empty, enriched, validated") is
SIZED by this script, not asserted by it. The dossier's disposition
(questions-and-dispositions.md C1) reads "Unmeasured, not zero" — the right
encoding, and the reason this script exists. Whether the fence is clear on any
given day is the OUTPUT of a run, never a premise baked into this file: the
Unknown total measured 512 at ingestion, 519 when Arc 0 opened, 544 at the
clause-1 attestation (2026-09-19), and 0 on 2026-09-22. Nothing in the control
flow below may depend on which of those numbers is current.

The re-scoping in that disposition is the whole point: fence 1 does NOT require
a full-corpus enrichment. It requires resolving `Unknown` for the subsystems in
the RUNTIME'S WRITE SET. This script measures that intersection so the operator
can size the fence instead of guessing at it.

WHY THIS IS A SCRIPT AND NOT A NUMBER IN A REPORT. The Unknown count moves —
it was 512 when the dossier measured and 519 by the time Arc 0 opened, without
anyone working on it. A fence keyed to a number that drifts needs a command,
not a citation.

WHAT THIS DELIBERATELY DOES NOT DO. It does not classify anything, write any
Fabric card, or touch the runtime. Arc 0 is measurement-only by its own scope
fence (`.context/arcs/ewcr-arc0-contract-evidence.yaml`).

Exit codes:
    0  measurement completed. This INCLUDES a run that enumerates cards and
       finds zero of them carrying `subsystem: Unknown` — that is a measured
       clear, and the enumerated-card total printed in the report is the
       evidence that the scan was not empty.
    2  REFUSED — the corpus could not be read, or zero Fabric CARDS were
       enumerated. Zero cards enumerated is not "no overlap"; it is "nothing
       was looked at", and reporting 0% overlap from an empty scan is the exact
       false-green this programme exists to eliminate.

THE TWO CONDITIONS ABOVE WERE CONFLATED until T-3438 (OBS-476). A zero Unknown
count was treated as proof that this script's own subsystem predicate must be
broken, on the premise that the corpus always holds some Unknown cards. That
premise was a corpus fact copied into a string — the mutable-corpus-anchor class
T-3326 names — it went false on 2026-09-22, and the script then refused on
success, turning T-3394's pinned verification line red three days after that
task closed green. The discriminator for "did we look at anything" is the CARD
total, which is read at run time on every invocation. It is not the Unknown
total, and it never was.
