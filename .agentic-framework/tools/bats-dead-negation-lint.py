"""T-3138: find bats assertions that cannot fail.

Bash exempts a command from `errexit` when "the command's return value is being
inverted with `!`" (bash manual, `set -e`). Bats runs each `@test` body under
`set -e` and reports the body's exit status. Put those two together:

    @test "x" {
        run some_command
        ! echo "$output" | grep -q "must not appear"   # <- CANNOT fail this test
        [ "$status" -eq 0 ]                            # <- this is the verdict
    }

The `!` line is exempt from errexit, so a non-zero result does not abort the
body; and it is not the last statement, so its status is not the body's status
either. The assertion is inert. It reads exactly like a working one.

A `!`-inverted line that IS the last statement of its body is fine — bats takes
the body's exit status from it. Those are counted and NOT flagged.

This is a lint over source text, not a runtime check, because the defect is
invisible at runtime by construction: a dead assertion and a passing assertion
produce identical output.

Usage:
    tools/bats-dead-negation-lint.py [PATH ...] [--json]

Exit 0 when nothing is flagged, 1 when dead assertions are found, 2 on bad usage.

Wired into (T-3191): `agents/audit/audit.sh` `check_dead_negation_lint`, in the
structure section, over the whole `tests/` tree. That section is both cron'd
(`*/30 * * * * ... audit --section structure ...`) and run by `git`'s
`pre-push` hook, so a newly-introduced dead negation cannot land without
tripping a gate someone did not have to choose to run. It is deliberately NOT
wired into `fw test lint` — that verb has the identical "nothing schedules it"
defect this file exists to close. See the T-3191 comment above
`check_dead_negation_lint` for the full reasoning.

# Distinguishing them needs BOTH a lookbehind and a lookahead. A lookahead alone
# still matches `<<< hi`: starting one character in, the second and third `<` are
# a valid two-char `<<` with a space after it, so (?!<) is satisfied and `hi`
# becomes a delimiter that swallows the rest of the file as data — every real
# finding below it silently disappears.
#
# Two rounds of measurement were needed to get here, and each was prompted by a
# control rather than by reading the regex. Mutation testing surfaced the first:
# deleting the guard outright left the suite green, because the fixture used a
# QUOTED here-string that the backreference rejected for an unrelated reason, so
# the guard was never exercised at all. Switching the fixture to `<<< hi` then
# went red against the lookahead-only form, which is what found this.
#
# Consumers of a finding: the reported line is the FIRST PHYSICAL line of a
# possibly line-continued statement. Replacing that line alone orphans the
# continuation, which bash then runs as its own command. T-3138's own sweep did
# exactly that at two sites before this note existed.

    such sites were flagged by the first draft of this lint and are live.

    `&&` is deliberately NOT treated the same way. In `! cmd && cmd2`, the
    failure that matters (cmd unexpectedly succeeding) makes `! cmd` return 1,
