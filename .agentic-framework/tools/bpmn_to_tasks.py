"""Child-2 forward compiler (first slice): BPMN process diagram -> AEF task skeletons.

Reads a BPMN 2.0 `.bpmn` file and emits one AEF task-skeleton frontmatter block per
task node (userTask / serviceTask / scriptTask). The stable task identity is the
`aef:uid` carried in each node's `<bpmn:extensionElements>` (IW-1 keystone, ratified
2026-07-11; 832 proved the seam round-trips both ways via T-187/T-188).

Design inputs (settled — see docs/reports/T-2522-bpmn-aef-mapping-contract.md and the
T-2523 DM rail):
  - IW-1: aef:uid lives in <extensionElements>; it is the modify/create discriminator.
  - IW-7: Lane = authority-of-record for who-performs. owner is compiled FROM the lane.
  - IW-9 (832 T-189 draft, pending Dimitri graduation): two orthogonal axes only —
    Lane (WHO) and workflow_type (KIND). Node-level `owner` override is REMOVED; a
    node's owner IS its lane. This compiler already honours that: it reads owner from
    the lane and ignores any node-level owner meta.
  - Ratified rulings: tier default = 1; AC-seeding = a real [NEEDS-FILL] skeleton,
    never a template placeholder.
  - O-1 (open, operator call): a serviceTask in a human lane resolves Lane-wins + WARN
    (antifragile — emit from the lane, warn, never refuse the whole diagram).

Slice 3 (T-2534): inception subProcess mapping. A <subProcess> bearing
<aef:meta workflowType="inception"> compiles to a skeleton with workflow_type:inception
and owner:human. The go/no-go is IMPLIED at the boundary (ratified G-3) — phase-1
collapsed subProcesses carry NO child gateway, so we synthesize the decision from the
marker, never by parsing a child <exclusiveGateway>. Owner comes from the lane's
authority-of-record (<aef:laneMeta authority="sovereignty"> ⇒ human). Per O-3 (graduated
v1.1, 832 T-195, rail offset 47), an inception's go/no-go boundary MUST be
sovereignty-laned: a mis-laned inception is malformed and the compiler FAILS FAST
(MalformedInceptionError) rather than silently forcing owner=human (the pre-graduation
interim, T-2537). The subProcess's <aef:constituents> steps surface as an AC-seed comment.
(Contract: 832 rail offset 32/34; scopeOf is the T-081 composition back-ref, NOT the
inception signal.)

Scope note: parse one .bpmn, extract task nodes + inception subProcesses + aef:uid +
lane, emit valid AEF task-skeleton frontmatter to stdout. Reverse direction
(tasks->diagram) is 832's, out of scope.

Namespace note: the compiler matches BPMN and aef elements by LOCAL NAME (namespace
prefix/URI agnostic), so it is forward-compatible with 832's actual `aef:` namespace
URI once the vendored corpus lands.

# BEHAVIOUR IS UNCHANGED from T-2567 (agent fallback, 832-ratified rail offset 95:

# `external` says "not us": the step is performed by a system or party outside the

# It therefore needs its own set: AUTHORITY_OWNER and AUTHORITY_NO_OWNER both still
# EMIT a skeleton (they differ only in where `owner` comes from), so neither is the
# right home. Before this, `external` was absent from every set, fell to the
# out-of-dialect branch, and emitted `owner: agent` — the exact inverse of the rule.

# 832, the contract owner, on agent-chat-arc @535: "external must produce no task,

# serialises as authority="none". That is the editor's DEFAULT authoring path, which
# means this fired more often than `external` ever did, and it accused the author of a
# spelling mistake for having drawn a lane and not yet filled it in.
#
# Deliberately NOT a member of AUTHORITY_DIALECT / _OWNER / _NO_OWNER / _NO_TASK. It is
# not in the frozen standard's four; adding it to any of those sets would ratify an
