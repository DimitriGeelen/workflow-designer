"""T-3749: run `fw inception decide` detached, so Watchtower never kills it.

Watchtower used to run the decide chain through run_fw_command(timeout=30).
Measured on this repo (tests/scripts/t3749-decide-timing.sh) the chain took
~40 s: the task reached completed/ at ~23 s and post-move side effects
(component resolution, episodic, emit_review) ran to the end. The timeout
killed the chain mid-flight and the page reported "Command timed out" as a
gate refusal, for a decision that had landed (T-3631, 2026-10-02).

Shape of the fix:

* `launch()` starts `python3 -m web.decide_runner --run …` in its own session
  (start_new_session), so neither a request timeout nor a Watchtower restart
  reaches it. The runner runs the decide with no timeout, logs stdout/stderr
  to a run directory under .context/working/decide/, and records progress and
  the exit code in status.json. It commits the decision as soon as it lands
  and again when the chain ends (episodic, components, Updates) — the request
  itself never commits, so it never waits on git or the commit lock.
* One chain per task: launch() takes an exclusive flock on
  .context/working/decide/<task>.lock and hands it to the runner, which passes
  it on to fw, so it is held until the chain itself has ended — a runner that
  dies, even before recording fw_pid, does not free it. As a second line,
  launch() also refuses while the recorded fw_pid is alive (/proc-checked). A second GO
  click while a chain is running gets `Busy`.
* `classify()` turns (landed, completed, running, rc) into one outcome; the
  blueprint words its message from that. A still-running chain is never
  described as a timeout or a gate refusal, and only a plain non-zero exit
  (a gate's own refusal) gets gate wording — a signal or crash is
  LANDED_INTERRUPTED.
* `surface()` reports, on the inception page, a run that exited non-zero, a
  commit that failed, or a runner that died before finishing.
