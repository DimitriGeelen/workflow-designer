# Git Agent - Hook installation subcommand

# T-2852: the version of the commit-msg hook TEMPLATE in this file — i.e. the
# value written as `# VERSION=` into the heredoc below, and therefore the value
# that will be read back out of an installed hook on the next run.
#
# This is deliberately NOT `$VERSION` (agents/git/git.sh:19), which is the git
# agent's own version. Those were compared against each other for an unknown
# span: the template said 1.11, the agent said 1.6, so the equality at the
# "already installed" check could never hold, the fast path was unreachable, and
# every install-hooks call rewrote all four hooks while announcing a move from
# the installed marker to the agent's number — phrasing that reads as a
# downgrade and produced a confident, wrong bug report from a live onboarding
# run (/opt/001-test-install, 2026-08-07). The old wording is deliberately not
# reproduced here: a regression test greps this file for it, and quoting the
# string one claims to have removed is its own recurring mistake (T-2847).
#
# git.sh already carried a comment instructing whoever edits a template to keep
# the two in sync. It was correct and it was ignored across five marker bumps,
# which is why the guard is now a test (tests/unit/hook_version_marker_parity.bats)
# rather than a sixth sentence of prose.
#
# PL-078 still applies: when you change the CONTENT of any hook template below,
# bump this constant AND the `# VERSION=` literal in the commit-msg heredoc
# together, so consumers' next install-hooks redeploys all four.
COMMIT_MSG_HOOK_VERSION="1.15"

# T-2813: verify a hook actually landed by reading state back from disk,
# rather than trusting that the `cat`/`chmod` calls that wrote it didn't
# print an error. `cat > "$hook" << 'EOF'` fails silently at the redirect
# (e.g. hooks directory missing) *before* any command in the heredoc body
# runs, so neither a captured exit status nor the heredoc content itself
# is a reliable signal — only the resulting file is.

# T-2240: Self-vendor drift gate (F2 N×M closure).
# Origin: T-2095 extracted _self_vendor_libs() into `fw vendor self`; T-2232 made
# the in-consumer upgrade path durable via .upstream sentinel; T-2239 split the
# dry-run wording ("would sync" vs "synced"). The gap T-2240 closes: editing
# lib/*.sh without running `fw vendor self` leaves the vendored copy at
# .agentic-framework/lib/ stale. `fw upgrade` is the only flow that catches it,
# and upgrade is not part of the push flow — so consumers that vendor from
# origin/master inherit the stale lib/ silently.
#
# Guard 1: only run in the framework repo (consumers have no root-level bin/fw —
# their fw lives at .agentic-framework/bin/fw and they don't have a vendored
# .agentic-framework/lib/ to drift). Consumer-safe by construction.
# Guard 2: FW_SKIP_SELF_VENDOR_CHECK=1 bypass for legitimate skip scenarios
# (e.g. release prep where vendor refresh is the next commit). Tier-2 visibility
# via stderr WARN — matches existing hook pattern (no separate log writes).
# T-3125: the detector above judges the WORKING TREE; the property this gate
# protects is about the PUSHED REF. `fw vendor self --dry-run` compares
# working-tree source against working-tree vendored copies, so ANY session with
# an uncommitted edit to a vendored-class file blocked EVERY other session's
# push, with no exit but a Tier-2 or Tier-0 bypass. Observed live 2026-08-23: 19
# commits held for hours by a concurrent session's uncommitted bin/fw and
# agents/audit/audit.sh — for both, `git show HEAD:<src>` was byte-identical to
# the vendored blob. The ref being pushed was clean; the block was false.
#
# So the dry-run stays as the cheap DETECTOR, and these two helpers decide
# whether the drift it found actually exists in the COMMITTED tree.
#
# _t3125_vendor_class mirrors the classes `fw vendor self --check` syncs
# (lib/bin/agents/web/policy/.tasks-templates/designer). It is a deliberate

    # does downstream, discovered later and attributed elsewhere.

Git Agent - Install Hooks Command

Usage: git.sh install-hooks [options]

Options:
  -f, --force   Force reinstall even if same version
  -h, --help    Show this help

Installs:
  - commit-msg hook: Validates task reference in commit message
  - post-commit hook: Detects bypasses and reminds to log them
  - pre-push hook: Runs audit before push (blocks on FAIL, and on could-not-run)

The hooks enforce task traceability (P-002: Structural Enforcement).

Pre-push behavior:
  - Audit FAIL (exit 2): Push blocked
  - Audit WARN (exit 1): Push allowed with warning
  - Audit PASS (exit 0): Push allowed
  - Bypass: fw tier0 approve && git push --no-verify (Tier 0 protected)
