# agents/git/lib/secret-scan.sh — Secret-scan library for the pre-commit hook (T-1844).
#
# Origin: T-1828/T-1834 incident — an Azure DevOps PAT was committed to framework
# history at 79e3361d (T-1736 spike). GitHub mirror blocked for 9+ hours.
# The framework had no structural gate against secrets reaching commits.
#
# This module is invoked by the pre-commit hook installed by
# agents/git/lib/hooks.sh:install_hooks. It can also be run standalone:
#
#   secret-scan.sh scan-staged       Scan git staged diff (the hook's mode)
#   secret-scan.sh scan-tree         Scan the entire working tree (audit mode)
#   secret-scan.sh scan-file <path>  Scan a specific file
#
# Configuration:
#   .secret-scan-patterns   TSV catalogue (name<TAB>regex)
#   .secret-scan-allowlist  One regex per line; matching findings suppressed
#
# Optional escalation:
#   If `gitleaks` is on PATH, run it as a second pass and treat any finding
#   as a match. The baseline regex catalogue is the always-on guarantee.

# ── Name axis (T-2897) ──────────────────────────────────────────────────────
#
# Everything above this line keys on file CONTENT against vendor-prefixed
# credentials (AKIA…, ghp_…, sk-ant-…, -----BEGIN). That is the right shape for
# third-party credentials and the wrong shape for ours: `secrets.token_hex(32)`
# is 64 bare hex characters with no prefix, no vendor and no assignment to
# anchor on. The one class of secret the framework is guaranteed to PRODUCE is
# the class a content scanner is structurally guaranteed to MISS, because
# "carries no third-party fingerprint" is what self-generated means. No number
# of added patterns closes that; only a second axis does.
#
# The axis nothing was reading is filenames. `.fw-secret-key` announced exactly
# what it was, in its name, for the two months it sat in 832's tree while every
# audit printed "[PASS] Secret scan: tracked tree clean" (rail 498). L-521: a
# detector's indexing strategy, not its pattern count, determines what it sees.
#
# Two classes, and the weaker one says so. DEFINITIVE is an exact name or an
# extension that means credential material and nothing else. ANNOUNCED pairs a
# secrecy word with a credential noun and is a heuristic — it is labelled that
# way in the output so a maybe never reads as a certainty.
#
# `token` is deliberately NOT a standalone signal: 832 measured 17 matches on
# their tree and every one was a false positive (token-budget reports, design
# tokens, a CSRF-token RCA). It survives only as the noun half of a pair.
#
# Tracked files only. An untracked key on disk is the normal, correct state —
# that is what the .gitignore rules from T-2896 produce. Only publication is
# the leak.

# The two halves must be DIFFERENT KINDS of word — a qualifier and a noun.
# First cut had `credential` in both lists, so the single word "credentials"
# satisfied the pair by itself and the scan fired on three fabric cards
# describing credential-handling *source* (lib-url-credentials.yaml and
# friends). A pair that one word can complete is not a pair; it is a
# single-word match wearing a pair's clothes, and it re-introduces exactly the
# 17/17 noise 832 measured on bare `token`. Qualifiers here, nouns below.
#
# T-2898: that paragraph was already written when `pass` (noun) went in
# alongside `password` and `passwd` (qualifiers), and `pass` is a substring of
# both — so the single word "password" completed the pair by itself, exactly the
# defect the paragraph forbids, one word over. `passwd-rotation.yaml`,
# `password-reset.yaml` and `password-policy.json` all classified ANNOUNCED.
#
# The repair is 832's (their rail 503, same class in their scanner): the two
# halves must match at NON-OVERLAPPING SPANS of the name. That makes the rule
# structural. Curating the lists apart would fix these three strings and leave
# the rule that permitted them — the next author to add a plausible word to both
# lists brings it straight back, with nothing in the code saying why they
# shouldn't.
#
# So `password`/`passwd` and `pass` STAY IN BOTH LISTS DELIBERATELY. Both words
# genuinely belong in their roles; the span rule is what makes the overlap
# harmless. tests/unit/secret_scan_span_rule.bats fails if the overlap is ever
# curated away, because an empty overlap would make the generative leg pass for
# the wrong reason.
#
# Note what did NOT show the bug: `reset-password.md` and `password_reset_test.py`
# come back clean — via the prose/source extension filter below, not via the pair
# logic. The two cases that would have surfaced this were suppressed by something
# else, and what was left unmasked is `.json`/`.yaml`: config data, the one file
# class no extension filter can exclude because it is where real secrets live.
#
# Space-separated word lists, not regex alternations — the span check needs the
# individual words, and a `|`-joined string cannot tell you which alternative matched.
_SECRET_NAME_SECRECY_WORDS='secret private passwd password auth signing'
_SECRET_NAME_NOUN_WORDS='key token cert creds credential pass'

# True when a qualifier and a noun both occur, at spans that do not overlap.
#
# Masks EVERY occurrence of EVERY qualifier out of the name, then requires a
# noun in what is left. Two properties this has and a first-occurrence split
# does not:
#
#   - The noun cannot be hiding inside a *second* qualifier. Splitting on the
#     first `auth` in `auth-password-policy.json` leaves `-password-policy.json`,
#     where `pass` is found inside `password` — disjoint spans, both of them
#     qualifiers, no noun anywhere in the name. Masking removes all of them.
#   - Masking with a SPACE, rather than deleting, means no noun match can be
#     assembled across the seam a removal would create: no noun contains a space.
#
# The first form of this function shipped with the split-on-first-occurrence bug
# above, and the fixture legs of the test all passed. The generative leg
# (probing every word in both lists, alone and doubled) is what failed and named
# `passwd-passwd` — which is why that leg exists rather than a list of known-bad
# filenames.
