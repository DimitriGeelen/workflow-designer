# T-1162/T-866/T-1464: flock guard + timeout — prevent zombie accumulation in cron AND
# foreground races. Cron-mode (QUIET=true) stays silent on collision; foreground prints
# a stderr message so the human knows why their audit didn't run.
#
# T-2930 / OBS-221: contention exits 75 (EX_TEMPFAIL), NOT 0, in BOTH lock modes.
#
# The bug this fixes is not "contention exits 0" — exit 0 was deliberate, for cron's
# zero-zombie contract. The bug is that ONE code carried TWO meanings, and the two
# callers need opposite things from it:
#
#   cron      wants silence      — a contended run is a non-event, not a failure
#   pre-push  wants to refuse    — a contended run means the gate DID NOT EVALUATE
#
# Under exit 0 the pre-push hook read "did not run" as "ran and passed". Observed live
# 2026-08-11: a push printed "=== Pre-Push Audit Check ===", then "Another audit is
# already running — exiting", and was allowed through while an invariant was RED
# moments earlier. Nothing in the output distinguished audited-and-clean from
# not-audited-at-all — the same false-green class as T-1376's port-3000 literal.
#
# 75 is EX_TEMPFAIL from sysexits.h: it already means transient/retry to any reader,
# where a private code like 3 would mean nothing outside this repo. Exit codes now
# partition cleanly and every caller can tell the three apart:
#
#   0   ran, no failures        1   ran, warnings        2   ran, FAILURES
#   75  DID NOT RUN — lock contention; the verdict is unknown, not clean
#
# Callers decide what "did not run" is worth. See agents/git/lib/hooks.sh (blocks) and
# the cron note below (immune — every generated audit line pipes to logger, so the
# pipeline exit code is logger's and no audit code ever reaches cron; pinned by
# tests/unit/t2930_audit_contention_exit_code.bats so that immunity stops being an
# accident that a future edit could silently revoke).

# --- Verdict-over-a-set emitters (T-3105) ---
#
# THE RULE: a check may only PASS over the set it actually evaluated, and must
# report that set's size. An empty or unenumerable candidate set is a WARN, not
# a PASS.
#
# Origin — three same-day instances of one class. None of them lied; each was
# true of what it looked at. The defect is that none STATED what it looked at,
# so "I found nothing" and "I looked nowhere" rendered identically:
#
#   1. The GO-scope-not-propagated scan (repaired by hand in T-3099) gated on a
#      prose phrase matching 2 of 444 completed inceptions, and 0 after the next
#      filter. Its candidate set was empty by construction, so every PASS it ever
#      printed asserted nothing — with 179 approved inceptions invisible behind
#      it.
#   2. This file's duplicate-task-ID check scans the main checkout only. Three
#      duplicate IDs living in worktree replicas were invisible for seven weeks
#      while it printed PASS.
#   3. Off-framework sibling: an errors store that returns "No errors found"
#      when it cannot read the store — byte-identical to a genuinely clean run.
#
# "No duplicate task IDs" is not falsifiable. "No duplicate task IDs among 3124
# task file(s)" is: a reader who believes the corpus is larger than 3124 now has
# something to disagree with. That is the whole point — the count is not
# decoration, it is the claim's scope, and a claim without a scope cannot be
# wrong, which is why it also cannot be trusted.
#
#   pass_over <count> "<set-description>" "<message>" [<evidence>] [<mitigation>]
#     count > 0         -> pass "<message> — examined <count> <set-description>"
#     count == 0        -> warn "<message> — NOT EVALUATED: candidate set empty"
#     empty/non-numeric -> routed to warn_unenumerable (see below)
#
#   warn_unenumerable "<source>" "<message>" [<evidence>] [<mitigation>]
#     -> warn "<message> — NOT EVALUATED: could not read <source>"
#
# Two verbs rather than one, because the two failures are known at different
# moments. "The set was empty" is known AFTER enumeration returns a number.
# "Could not enumerate" is known BEFORE any number exists — a missing store, an
# unreadable path, an absent dependency, a `$(python3 ... 2>/dev/null)` that
# collapsed to the empty string. T-3099's hand implementation had exactly this
# two-part shape: it tested for an empty pre-scan summary and warned, then
# parsed the counts and branched on zero. Folding both into one verb would force
# every caller to invent a sentinel count for "I never got one", and the obvious
# sentinel — 0 — is precisely the value that must NOT be conflated with it.
#
# pass_over therefore routes a non-numeric count to warn_unenumerable rather
# than trusting it: a caller whose command substitution collapsed to "" must not
# be reported as having measured a set of size 0. It measured nothing.
#
# Both paths WARN, never FAIL. audit's exit code 2 means a real failure; a check
# that did not evaluate is an unknown, and an unknown that exits 2 would train
# readers to ignore it. The same reasoning as the audit's own lock-contention
# exit 75 above: "did not run" is its own verdict, distinct from both pass and

# corpus rather than the main checkout alone.
#
# A git worktree checks out its own snapshot of `.tasks/`, so "the task corpus"
# is the UNION of every worktree's view (see fw_task_view_dirs, lib/paths.sh,
# T-3104). Scanning one view printed "No duplicate task IDs" for seven weeks
# while T-2505, T-2506 and T-2428 each named a DIFFERENT task in a worktree
# replica.
#
# THE DISCRIMINATOR IS IDENTITY, NOT CONTENT. Git hands the same committed task
# to every worktree, and a worktree pinned to an older commit holds an older
# REVISION of that task — same task, different bytes. On this repo's corpus a
# content-hash compare yields 2744 findings and dies of irrelevance; `created:`
# (fixed at allocation, never rewritten) yields exactly 3 — the three known
# collisions, zero false positives. Falls back to the filename slug for the 18
# legacy files with no parseable `created:`. Do not "simplify" this back to a
# hash compare; tests/unit/t3107_corpus_duplicate_ids.bats tests 5-7 pin it.
#
# Four classes, three verdicts:
#   same ID twice INSIDE one view      -> FAIL (allocator bug, live)
#   across views, identity differs     -> WARN (fork artifact: two tasks, one number)
#   across views, identity same        -> silent, counted as differing revisions
#   across views, byte-identical       -> silent, counted as replication
# The FAIL and the WARN are emitted independently: an ID can be both, and
# neither may mask the other (test 7).

# T-2980 (arc-017, onboarding-curriculum): seed → corpus-map reference resolution.

# embed their content. That created a reference class nothing checked: each seeded
# task's `## For the Operator` section ends with `fw corpus explain <id>`, and if
# that id stops resolving the operator gets a tool error in their first hour, from
# a system they have no model of yet.
#
# FAIL rather than WARN, deliberately diverging from the anchor_task sibling above.
# Three reasons: the reference is a command we TELL a first-time operator to run,
# so the blast radius is the framework's first impression; the seeds are templates
# copied into every consumer project by `fw init`, so a dangling ref ships to every
# install made after it lands and is found one confused operator at a time; and the
# fix is a one-line edit. Warning about a deterministic, trivially-fixable,
# operator-facing dead end would be the wrong tier.

# T-2985 (arc-014, designer-corpus): corpus-lint findings reach the daily audit.
#
# The detectors work; nothing converted their output into work. `fw corpus lint` is
# not in audit, not on cron, not in any `## Verification` block — so a finding
# persisted exactly as long as nobody happened to type the command. T-2984 is the
# worked example: lane-geometry (T-2684) and lane-overflow (T-2688/T-2689) both fired
# on aef-session-lifecycle for ~4 weeks. That map is vendored into every consumer
# (T-2942) and is the one existing-project/T-001 routes a first-time operator to. It
# was found by hand-auditing arc-014, which is not a mechanism.
#
# WARN, not FAIL — and unlike the T-2980 sibling directly above, that divergence is
# the point. Seed→map references are homogeneous: dangling is always broken. Corpus
# findings are not. `emitterless-typed-event` on aef-dispatch-loop@v3 is a real seam
# (a typed catch whose throw legitimately lives outside the corpus), and `legacy-ref`
# on t2584-scratch is a scratch artefact. A blanket FAIL would exit 2 on a correct
# corpus, and an audit that fails for a known-acceptable reason trains people to stop
# reading it — which costs more than the findings do.
#
# Silent where the linter or the store is absent: vendored consumers may not carry
# tools/, and a fresh project has no map store. No traceback, no spurious WARN, and
# no PASS line claiming a scan that did not happen.

# T-2096 (OBS-036, sibling to L-417/T-1975): GO-scope-not-propagated scan.
# Forwards-pointing companion to the L-417 detector above. L-417 catches
# satellite text claiming "ships in T-NNNN" where T-NNNN is already
# completed (backwards staleness). This detector catches the inverse: a
# completed inception that recorded a GO and then propagated nothing — no
# related_tasks:, nobody back-referencing it, no build task declaring it via
# unlocks_inception_decision:. The GO scope was approved but never became
# work; humans following the breadcrumbs find a dead-end.
# Origin: T-2078 (May-29) — Recommendation said "V1 build slices (filed on GO)"
# but related_tasks: [] and the V1-a/b/c/d slices did not exist until T-2091's
# G-052 sweep backfilled them as T-2092..T-2095. WARN (not FAIL): a finding is
# "somebody should triage this", and the standing backlog is pre-existing debt,
# not a regression.
#
# T-3099: the candidate gate is STRUCTURAL. It was a regex over prose --
#   CLAIM_RE = r'filed on GO|sub-tasks (filed|created)|build slices (filed|created)
#               |child tasks (filed|spun off)'
# -- which measured 2 matches across 444 completed inceptions, 0 of which
# survived the related_tasks filter. The candidate set was empty by
# construction, so every PASS this check ever printed was vacuous. A rail keyed
# to how an author phrased a promise is silent exactly when the author writes
# carefully: an inverse correlation with the thing being measured. T-2822 --
# whose unbuilt keystone slice kept the worktree class alive for two weeks past
# its own approval -- says "each is a separate build slice", which the regex
# does not match. See docs/reports/T-3097-worktree-rca.md IW-4.
# There is no vocabulary anywhere in the predicate now: GO recorded, no
# related_tasks, no back-reference, no unlocks_inception_decision.
#
# T-2298 (preserved): single python3 pre-scan, O(M+N). Pass 1 walks completed/
# once to find candidates; pass 2 walks active/+completed/ once to build the set
# of every task id referenced by a related_tasks: line or an
# unlocks_inception_decision: entry. The original per-candidate grep fan-out
# (~1500 completed tasks x 3-4 greps + a cross-file grep per survivor) took
# 30-60s wall-clock. Skips T-Test-* sentinels (T-2228 parity).

#
# The rail shipped 2026-07-04 with exactly one caller — `bin/fw doctor` — and
# doctor appears on ZERO cron lines. So nothing has ever put branch hygiene in
# front of anyone on a schedule, which is why four real strands (43-55 days,
# 202 unlanded commits on one of them) sat unread. This block is the same
# promotion `bin/fw doctor` -> audit that T-1771/T-1942/T-1943 did for cron
# drift: same surface, same cron, no new alert channel.
#
# It CALLS lib/branch-hygiene.sh rather than mirroring its classification. The
# cron-drift precedent above mirrored doctor's logic, and that second copy is
# the L-399 producer/consumer split this slice deliberately does not repeat —
# there is one predicate (fw_branch_hygiene) and both surfaces read it.
#
# WARN, never FAIL: T-3093 ruled out a blocking gate and per-strand auto-filing
# because both act on a signal whose false-positive rate was only fixed in
# slice 1 (T-3094 — recency, not behind-count), and both are much harder to
# walk back than a WARN. Audit's exit code is therefore unchanged by branch
# findings alone: warnings exit 1, never 2.

# T-3138 measured 106 inert `! cmd` bats assertions and shipped the linter, but
# wired it into no runner: no audit section, no `fw test lint`, no cron, no
# hook. T-3190 reintroduced the exact class two days later in a brand-new
# suite (tests/unit/t3190_release_master_ff.bats) and it went green on every
# surface that ran — only mutation testing (not a scheduled check) caught it.
#
# Placed here, not in `fw test lint`, because `fw test lint` has the identical
# defect this whole section exists to close: nothing schedules it either (see
# the T-2837 comment on check_invariant_suite above — 25 cron jobs, 5 run `fw
# audit`, none ran a test suite). Audit is the one surface that is both
# cron'd (`*/30 * * * * ... audit --section structure ...`) and gates
# `git push` (pre-push runs agents/audit/audit.sh directly) — a red finding
# here is unavoidable, not opt-in.
#
# Placed inline (not report-read like check_unit_suite_report below) because
# the cost profile is opposite tests/unit's: this is a pure Python source-text

# existed, hook installation drift on cron-run hosts. Audit-mode scan-tree
# closes the gap — same shape as the cron registry sync check above (the gate
# was wired but not measured at the audit horizon).
#
# T-3062: they belong to the DAILY horizon T-1845 named, and they were in
# `structure`, which is the horizon the pre-push hook runs on every push. That
# mismatch is why they are their own section now.
#
# Measured on this repo, `--section structure` before the split:
#
#   everything up to the hook-threshold check   51s
#   secret scan   (scan-tree)                  188s
#   large-file    (scan-tree)                   95s
#   the remaining nine checks                   13s
#   ------------------------------------------------
#   total                                      347s
#
# The pre-push hook bounds a push at 60s (handover.sh `_push_timeout`), so the
# gate could not finish inside the window it is given, on any path. Pushes were
# not blocked — they were killed partway through, which looks the same from the
# outside and reports nothing. Seven commits sat unpushed across four sessions.
# The same 283s was also being paid every 30 minutes by the `structural-30m`
# cron, which is where the audit lock contention in T-1719/OBS-221 came from.
#
# Scoping, so this stays honest: `should_run_section` is true for every section
# when no `--section` filter is given, so a full audit (`fw audit --cron`, the
# daily 08:00 job) still runs these. What changes is that a caller who asks for
# `structure` by name no longer gets them. Coverage moves from every-30-minutes
# to daily — which is the horizon T-1845 asked for in the first place. To run
# them on demand: `fw audit --section tree`.

# completed detector below both shipped as CTL-029 — T-1903 claimed the id first,
# T-2055 reused it. The id stayed with T-2055's control because every downstream
# reference had attached to it (tests/unit/test_audit_completable_not_completed.bats
# asserts the literal "CTL-029: ... has all Agent ACs ticked", and
# docs/reports/T-2137 cites CTL-029 four times meaning that control). Renumbering
# this one touched only audit.sh. Audit logs and reports predating 2026-08-16 that
# say CTL-029 may mean either — disambiguate on the message text, not the id.
# Detects tasks in active/ with status: work-completed AND zero unchecked
# checkboxes (after HTML-comment strip). These are archive-eligible but
# didn't auto-archive because the partial-complete recheck only re-fires
# on `--status work-completed` re-invocation. Triggered by T-1894/T-1897-
# style re-class operations that drain Human ACs to zero after the first

# whole-run record (total_seconds vs the AUDIT_TIMEOUT ceiling), and a scoped
# run's total answers a different question — see the AUDIT_TIMING_FILE comment
# above. Per-section facts go to section_runs: from section_mark; the full-run
# summary stays gated. Two records, two lifetimes, one file.
