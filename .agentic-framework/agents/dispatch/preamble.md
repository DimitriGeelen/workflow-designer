## The Preamble (copy this into every dispatch prompt)

```
## OUTPUT RULES — MANDATORY, NON-NEGOTIABLE

You are a sub-agent with a STRICT output budget. The orchestrator that spawned
you has limited context. Violating these rules will crash the session.

1. **Write all detailed output to disk** using the Write tool
   - Output file: /tmp/fw-agent-{describe-your-task-briefly}.md
   - Write BEFORE composing your final response

2. **Your final response MUST be ≤ 5 lines:**
   - Line 1: DONE or FAIL
   - Line 2: Output file path
   - Line 3: One-sentence summary of findings
   - Line 4-5: (optional) Critical numbers only (e.g., "Pass: 80 | Fail: 3")

3. **NEVER return in your response:**
   - File contents (even partial)
   - Code blocks longer than 3 lines
   - YAML/JSON data
   - Lists longer than 5 items
   - Full error traces

4. The orchestrator will read your output file if it needs details.

EXAMPLE GOOD RESPONSE:
  DONE
  /tmp/fw-agent-ac-audit.md
  Audited 212 tasks: 126 REAL (59%), 86 problematic (41%)
  Before P-010: 20% REAL | After P-010: 94.5% REAL

EXAMPLE BAD RESPONSE:
  Here are the detailed findings for each task:
  T-001: REAL - has 3 checked ACs...
  T-002: MISSING - no AC section...
  [200 more lines]
```

## Fabric Awareness (T-247)

When your task involves **modifying source files**, follow these rules:

1. **Before editing a registered component**, check its dependents:
   - Run: `fw fabric deps <file-path>` to see what depends on it
   - If it has >5 dependents, mention this in your summary so the orchestrator can run blast-radius

2. **When creating new files**, note them in your summary:
   - The post-commit hook will detect unregistered files and suggest registration
   - Include the file paths in your output so the orchestrator can track them

3. **Do NOT run** `fw fabric register` or `fw fabric blast-radius` yourself — the orchestrator handles these via hooks. Just report what you modified/created.

## TermLink Workers — Different Output Rules

TermLink workers (`fw termlink dispatch`) are NOT sub-agents. They run in
independent processes with their own context budget. The `/tmp/` convention
above does NOT apply to them — it exists to prevent context explosion in
Task tool agents, which share the parent's context window.

**For TermLink dispatch, the orchestrator MUST:**
1. Specify the **target output path** in the dispatch prompt (e.g., `docs/reports/T-816-analysis.md`)
2. NOT include the `/tmp/fw-agent-*` instruction — use the target file directly
3. Instruct the worker to write output to the target file in the git repo

**Why this matters (T-818):** If the parent session hits budget critical before
integrating worker results, outputs in `/tmp/` are lost. T-816 incident: a
TermLink worker wrote 307 lines to `/tmp/fw-agent-T-816-*.md` but the parent
couldn't copy it to `docs/reports/` because the budget gate blocked Write.
Had the worker written directly to `docs/reports/`, the output would have
survived regardless of parent session state.

**TermLink dispatch prompt template:**
```
Write your analysis directly to: docs/reports/T-XXX-topic.md
Do NOT write to /tmp/. Your output must be in the git repo.
When done, your final message should be ≤ 5 lines:
  DONE
  docs/reports/T-XXX-topic.md
  One-sentence summary
```

### Commit the post-transition diff (L-419, T-1985 + T-1951 origin)

If your worker's final action is `bin/fw task update T-XXX --status work-completed`,
that transition rewrites task frontmatter (status, owner, date_finished, last_update)
— and the worker exits before committing it. The parent then has to sweep stranded
deltas across `.tasks/active/T-XXX-*.md`.

**Worker exit protocol:** after the transition succeeds, the very next action MUST be:

```bash
bin/fw task update T-XXX --status work-completed && \
  git add .tasks/active/T-XXX-*.md && \
  FW_SWITCH_FOCUS=1 bin/fw git commit -m "T-XXX: work-completed transition"
```

Origin: T-1985 (G-066 prong 2 worker) and T-1951 (G-066 prong 3 worker) both shipped
clean slice commits, ran the transition, then exited — leaving the frontmatter
delta uncommitted. The pattern will recur across every TermLink-dispatched worker
that completes a task in its own session.

## TermLink Dispatch — Orchestrator-Aware Workers (T-1643)

When you dispatch via `fw termlink dispatch`, the framework now understands
the orchestrator substrate built in T-1061. Three things to know:

### 1. Pass `--task-type` (or rely on auto-derivation)

The dispatcher accepts `--task-type build|inception|design|test|refactor|...`.
If omitted, it auto-derives from `.context/working/focus.yaml` → active task's
`workflow_type`. The worker's `meta.json` records `task_type` for downstream
routing and audit.

**Tag specialist sessions explicitly:** when spawning a long-lived worker that
will handle a specific task class, pass `--task-type` so `termlink discover
--tag task-type:build` can find it. The orchestrator (in /opt/termlink) uses
this tag to route work to the right specialist.

### 2. Check `model_used` and `fallback_used` in the result manifest

After `fw termlink result <name>` returns, inspect the result manifest:

- `model_used` — actual LLM the worker ran with (may differ from `--model`
  if the orchestrator chose a different specialist)
- `fallback_used` — `true` if the requested specialist was unavailable and
  the orchestrator routed to a fallback

If `fallback_used` is `true`, surface it to the user — the answer came from
a different model than asked. Don't silently treat it as if the original
specialist responded.

### 3. Don't bypass the orchestrator on principle

The whole point of T-1061 was to let the orchestrator make routing decisions
the framework can't. If you find yourself thinking "I'll just dispatch with
`--model haiku` directly to bypass routing", check first whether a
`task-type:X` derivation would route correctly — that's the substrate
working as designed.

## Why This Exists

- T-073: 9 agents returned full YAML → 177K token spike → session crash
- Multiple sessions lost to context explosion from agent result ingestion
- The `fw bus` system was built for this but goes unused without this preamble

## Orchestrator-Side Rules

After dispatching agents:
1. Use `run_in_background: true` for any agent expected to produce >500 tokens
2. Read only the final summary from the agent (last 5 lines of output)
3. If you need details, read the output file the agent wrote — don't ask the agent
4. NEVER use `TaskOutput` with `block: true` for background agents (returns full JSONL transcript)
5. Use `Bash: tail -5 /tmp/claude-*/tasks/{agent-id}.output` to get just the summary
