# the dump. T-3025's GO elides that dump, which promotes this frontmatter to the
# only carrier of task state. The IW-2 probe measured the consequence directly:
# given the digest alone, the reader read 82 parked tasks as live work and named
# one as in-progress, with high confidence.

# Filtering alone would be lossy — a parked or awaiting-review task is still worth
# surfacing — so the states the old field absorbed get their own fields. Union of

# ── SUGGESTED FIRST ACTION CARRY-FORWARD (T-862, OBS-383) ──────────────────────
#
# Every other section of this document is DERIVED — from git, from the task
# register, from the audit. Regenerating them from scratch each run is correct.
# Exactly one section is AUTHORED, and it is the only one a reader is invited to
# improve: Suggested First Action. Before T-862 the generator overwrote it
# unconditionally with a single computed line, so a hand-written plan survived
# precisely one regeneration. Measured four times on 2026-09-25/26; the cleanest
# pair is cfc7e9ed -> f98bf459, one commit apart, focus unchanged, 4,982 chars
# replaced by 7 lines.
#
# The loss was silent BY CONSTRUCTION. A stub is present, and a stub is not
# missing, so every completeness check the document has passed. Nothing anywhere
# compared a handover to its predecessor. That is the same false-green shape as
# the rest of T-841..T-861: the artefact looks finished because the check cannot
# tell "nothing to say" from "the words were discarded".
#
# WHAT THIS DOES NOT DO. It does not decide where handover content ought to live.
# OBS-383(b) — render the section from the focus task's body — would relocate
# authority over the content and is a Sovereign question, left open deliberately.
# Carrying bytes the generator did not author forward is data preservation and
# commits to nothing.
#
# THE DANGEROUS FAILURE IS NOT "it fails to carry". That shows up the first time
# anyone looks. It is "it carries always", which would silently present a plan
# written for a DIFFERENT task as this task's next step — a worse false-green
# than the one being fixed, and one that reads as authoritative. Hence the focus
# guard below, and hence the over-firing control in the teeth.
