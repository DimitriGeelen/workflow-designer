# Context Checkpoint Agent — Token-aware context budget monitor
# Reads actual token usage from Claude Code JSONL transcript to warn
# before automatic compaction causes context loss.
#
# Primary: Token-based warnings from JSONL transcript (checked every 5 calls)
# Fallback: Tool call counter (when transcript unavailable)
#
# Note: Token reading lags by ~1 API call (~10-30K behind actual).
# Thresholds are set conservatively to account for this.
#
# Usage:
#   checkpoint.sh post-tool   — Called by Claude Code PostToolUse hook
#   checkpoint.sh reset       — Reset tool call counter (on commit)
#   checkpoint.sh status      — Show current context usage + useful headroom
#   checkpoint.sh budget      — Safe reader for .budget-status (T-3241)
#   checkpoint.sh baseline    — Session BASELINE tokens, bare integer (T-3248)
#
# Part of: Agentic Engineering Framework (P-009: Context Budget Awareness)

# ── T-3248: useful-headroom BASELINE ─────────────────────────────────────────
# BASELINE = the context this session had already paid for at its FIRST measured
# turn — CLAUDE.md, the hook set, the injected handover, the opening prompt. It
# is the total (input + cache_read + cache_creation) of the EARLIEST usage entry
# of the dominant model since the last compact_boundary, filtered by
# .session-start-ts. Same scoping rules as lib/context_tokens.py, which returns
# the LAST in-scope entry (current usage); this takes the FIRST (the floor).
# Inlined rather than shared because the lib is out of T-3248's write-set — if
# the lib's scoping rules move, this scan must move with them.
# Same trust guard as the lib: fewer than 2 in-scope entries → 0 (not yet
# measurable), never a guess. Per-session-measured by construction: a heavier
# CLAUDE.md/hook set inflates the first turn's snapshot and thus the baseline.
# Reads the WHOLE transcript (no tail -c): the first entry lives at the HEAD of
# the post-boundary region, which a tail window truncates on long transcripts.
# Cached per (transcript, session-start-ts) in .session-baseline since the floor
# is constant for the life of a session — the full scan runs once. The cache is
# dropped on `reset` and on detected compaction (the floor is re-paid then).
