# --- Drift-target extraction (T-1730; hoisted out of the gate by T-2880) ---
# Answers ONE purely syntactic question: does this command name a task?
# It reads only $1 — no focus, no filesystem — which is why it can run in the
# Bash fast path far above the point where focus.yaml is parsed (line ~186).
#
# T-2880: that hoist is the whole fix. The fast path used to answer "does this
# need an active task?" with `exit 0`, and that single early return silently
# answered a SECOND, independent question — "is this attributed to the right
# task?" — with "don't care". The two are not the same question:
#
#     needs a task?          about the SESSION state  (is any work in progress)
#     attributed correctly?  about the COMMAND        (does it name another task)
#
# A command can be safe on the first and wrong on the second. `fw context
# add-learning "x" --task T-OTHER` needs no active task (T-2878 — it is what
# the framework prescribes right after completion, which is the exact moment
# focus is null) and is still misattributed if focus points elsewhere.
# Collapsing both into one `exit 0` made drift pattern 2 unreachable the moment
# T-2878 safe-listed the capture verbs — a gate that stopped being consulted
# while every test stayed green (L-555).

# than re-deriving it, so the two call sites cannot drift apart.

    # `exit 0` ahead of EVERY gate — the first real one is ~40 lines below — on a
    # regex that matches at any position, including inside a quoted argument. So
    # `rm -rf /important/data --help` was exempt, and so was
    # `git commit -m "document the --help flag"`. Any command could opt out of
    # governance by appending seven characters. Reproduced with a control leg:
    # bare `rm -rf /important/data` gated, the same command plus `--help` exempt.
    #
    # THE FIX IS TWO INDEPENDENT LEGS, because there are two distinct escapes:
    #   1. Decide on a QUOTE-STRIPPED view — kills the flag hiding in a quoted
    #      payload (`git commit -m "… --help …"`). This is exactly what the

    #      reason; it was simply never applied here.
    #   2. Refuse the exemption when the stripped command carries a WRITE
    #      PATTERN — kills `rm -rf … --help`. A real help invocation does not
    #      write, so this costs the legitimate case nothing.
    # Neither leg subsumes the other: leg 1 alone still exempts `rm -rf … --help`,
    # leg 2 alone still exempts the quoted-payload commit.
    #
    # FAILS CLOSED. If safe-commands.sh did not source, `has_bash_write_pattern`
    # is undefined, the `type` test is false, and the whole condition is false —
    # so the command falls through to the gates rather than being exempted. Do

#
# Every block below names a bootstrap command (`fw work-on` / `context focus`)
# as the unblock path, and the exemption at :194 and :227 honours exactly that.
# But the exemption is guarded by has_bash_write_pattern, which classifies the
# WHOLE command line while the exemption is about ONE command in it. So a `>`
# anywhere on the line — on an unrelated chained command, or merely capturing
# the bootstrap command's own output — voids it:
#
#     fw work-on T-016                 -> allowed
#     fw work-on T-016 && fw doctor    -> allowed
#     fw work-on T-016 > out.txt 2>&1  -> BLOCKED, and the block re-advertises
#                                         the very command that just failed
#
# That is a loop: identical message, no signal to change SHAPE rather than
# target. Reported from a fresh consumer whose focus pointed at a completed
# T-001 (T-2987), and hit in-session before that.
#
# The guard is NOT the bug and is not relaxed here — :213-222 argues for failing
# toward blocking, and L-547 (T-2834) says a fast-path exemption must classify
# the whole command. Widening it would admit `fw work-on X > .claude/settings.json`.
