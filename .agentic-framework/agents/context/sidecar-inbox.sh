# sidecar-inbox.sh — UserPromptSubmit hook: surface pending peer consults.
#
# T-3407 (arc-011 slice 5). Runs `fw sidecar inbox --peek --json` and, when
# consults are pending, emits them as additionalContext so the agent sees
# them at the start of its next turn without having been told to look.
#
# Three properties are load-bearing and each has a test:
#   PEEK, never consume — surfacing is not reading. A consult the hook
#     consumed and the agent then ignored would vanish from `fw sidecar
#     inbox`. The cursor is left where it was.
#   SILENT when empty — no consults means no stdout at all, so the common
#     case costs the turn nothing.
#   FAIL OPEN — no termlink, hub down, timeout, malformed JSON: empty
#     stdout, exit 0. A consult surface must never block a prompt.
#
# Invoked as: fw hook sidecar-inbox   (resolved via $AGENTS_DIR/context/)
