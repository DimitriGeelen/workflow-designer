# Stop hook — the continuous-run turn driver (T-3164, arc-012 S1).
#
# THE PROBLEM THIS SOLVES. Without a Stop hook, control returns to the idle prompt
# after every assistant turn. arc-012 built an entire continuous-run substrate —
# budget gauge, auto-handover, restart signal, iteration counter, tier ceiling,
# directive injector — on top of a loop that had no driver, so the mechanic never
# fired once across 26 tasks. T-2404 named the gap exactly and fixed it by appending
# prose asking the agent to invoke /resume: a repair that presumes the very turn it
# is trying to cause. This hook is that turn.
#
# THE CONTRACT, MEASURED (T-3163) — do not "simplify" this:
#   {"decision": "block", "reason": "..."}  -> Claude takes ANOTHER turn.   WORKS.
#   exit 2 with the reason on stderr        -> Claude takes ANOTHER turn.   WORKS.
#   {"ok": false, "reason": "..."}          -> INERT. Output is identical to
#                                              returning {}. A driver built on this
#                                              shape fires, logs, returns cleanly and
#                                              drives nothing — and only a control leg
#                                              can tell the difference.
#   {}                                      -> yield to the prompt (stop).
# Pinned by tests/unit/stop_driver.bats. The wrong shape is silently inert, which is
# why the assertion exists at all.
#
# POSTURE: DISARMED BY DEFAULT, AND FAILS CLOSED.
# Every path that is not an explicit, in-cap, un-halted continuation emits {} — absent
# state file, malformed YAML, missing python3, unreadable payload, any error at all.
# Registering this hook is a no-op for an ordinary session. That is deliberate: a
# driver that continued by default would take the operator's session away from them.
#
# SOVEREIGNTY (T-3159 IW-2). A component that decides whether to continue can decide
# not to stop. Three independent brakes, checked in this order:
#   1. HALT FILE      — read first, before anything else can vote. Out of band from
#                       the model's reasoning, so it works precisely when the model is
#                       the thing misbehaving. Operator writes it; nothing else clears
#                       it automatically.
#   2. OUR CAPS       — max_iterations, expires_at / expires_after_seconds.
#   3. PLATFORM CAP   — stop_hook_active, plus Claude Code's own 8-consecutive-block
#                       ceiling. We deliberately do NOT raise CLAUDE_CODE_STOP_HOOK_
#                       BLOCK_CAP: our counter is meant to stop the loop first, leaving
#                       the vendor's cap as the backstop we did not write.

    # a sentence carrying ITS OWN `now` — "expires_at 2026-06-17 passed (now
    # 2026-08-26T12:50:35Z)" — freezes that into the state file, and never
    # rewrites it while the loop stays disarmed (evaluate() returns early on
    # `not enabled`). log() then stamps the line with today. The result was 18
    # consecutive lines each carrying two clocks five days apart, the stale one
    # reading as current to anyone diagnosing "why won't the loop run".
