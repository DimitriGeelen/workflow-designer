# Budget Gate — PreToolUse hook that enforces context budget limits
# BLOCKS tool execution (exit 2) when context tokens exceed critical threshold.
#
# Exit codes (Claude Code PreToolUse semantics):
#   0 — Allow tool execution
#   2 — Block tool execution (stderr shown to agent)
#
# Architecture (T-138 hybrid):
#   - This hook is PRIMARY enforcement (PreToolUse = before execution)
#   - PostToolUse checkpoint.sh is FALLBACK (warnings + auto-handover)
#   - Optional cron job can write .budget-status externally (future)
#
# Performance target: <100ms per invocation
#   - Fast path: read .budget-status if fresh (<90s) — single Python call
#   - Slow path: read JSONL transcript — ~30ms (every 5th call)
#
# Part of: Agentic Engineering Framework (P-009: Context Budget Enforcement)

# T-2403: write the restart signal on the critical-BLOCK path so autonomous
# continuous mode actually arms. Previously the signal was written ONLY by
# checkpoint.sh (PostToolUse) inside its handover-success block — a path that is
# shut off at critical: general tools are blocked here (exit 2) → their
# PostToolUse never fires → checkpoint never writes the signal → the terminator
# waits forever → the loop dead-locks at link 1 and the iteration never advances.
# budget-gate is the PreToolUse hook that RELIABLY fires at critical (it is the
# thing detecting + blocking), so emitting the signal here decouples it from the
# blocked PostToolUse/handover path. Handover stays best-effort (claude -c
# preserves the conversation; post-compact-resume re-injects the directive), so a
# missing handover degrades context quality but does NOT break the loop.
#
# JSON shape matches checkpoint.sh:210-212 (timestamp, session_id, reason,
# tokens, optional directive fold from .next-directive.yaml) so claude-fw and
# post-compact-resume consume it identically. The whole body is wrapped so it can
# NEVER break the gate — this hook gates EVERY tool call, and a non-zero/partial
# failure here would block all tools. Called only on the BLOCK path (after the
# `allowed` check), never on the allowed path, so a restart can't fire while the
# agent is still wrapping up (mid-commit / mid-handover). Idempotent: budget-gate
# runs on every call, so the write may repeat while at critical — each repeat
# just refreshes the timestamp of an already-valid signal (the terminator acts on
# first detection, so churn is harmless).
