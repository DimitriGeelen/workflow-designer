# Safe-command allowlist for Bash task gate (T-650, T-630)
#
# is_bash_safe_command() returns 0 if the command is read-only/diagnostic
# and should be allowed without an active task.
#
# Design evidence: 7920 Bash invocations analyzed from real session data.
# Only 1.4% are file-writing operations. This allowlist catches the safe
# 98.6% for fast-path bypass.
#
# Categories (27 patterns):
#   1. Git read-only (8 patterns)
#   2. File reading (7 patterns)
#   3. Searching (4 patterns)

# --- T-2834: chain-aware entry point -------------------------------------
#
# _fw_chain_split emits one NUL-TERMINATED segment per chain operator that is
# NOT inside quotes: `&&`, `||`, `&`, `|`, `;`, and newline. Quote tracking
# matters — without it `grep -q "a && b"` splits into two bogus segments and a
# read-only command starts blocking.
#
# T-3223: the delimiter is NUL, not newline, and that is the whole point.
#
# This function was already quote-aware, so a newline inside a quoted argument
# was correctly kept INSIDE its segment. Then the segment was printed with
# `printf '%s\n'` and read back by `mapfile -t` / `read -r` — line-delimited.
# A segment that legitimately contained a newline arrived at the caller as
# several segments, each a fragment of a quoted string, none of them a command.
#
# Measured: a real multi-line commit message split into six clauses, five of
# which were prose from the message body, all read as unsafe. So `git add -A
# … && git commit -q -m "<multi-line message>"` — the framework's own
# documented post-completion form, in the shape agents actually type it —
# was refused. The short single-line fixtures in the test suite never met it.
#
# The structure was right and the CHANNEL threw it away, which is the same
# class this whole cluster keeps hitting (L-547, OBS-355) one layer down: a
# delimiter-scan standing in for structure, so an argument that CONTAINS a
# delimiter is treated as a boundary. NUL cannot appear in a bash command
# string, so it is the only delimiter that cannot collide with content.
#
# Callers MUST read with `-d ''`:
#     while IFS= read -r -d '' seg; do … done < <(_fw_chain_split "$cmd")
# `read -d ''` is bash 4.0+; `mapfile -d` would need 4.4, so the loop form is
# used at every call site for portability (D4).
#
# Deliberately NOT handled: command substitution. `echo $(git commit -m 'T-X: y')`
# still reads as safe. Extracting `$(...)` as a segment would also catch the
# framework's own documented idiom `curl -sf "$(bin/fw watchtower url)/page"` —
# `fw watchtower` is not on the allowlist, so that verification pattern would
# start blocking whenever no task is active, which is exactly the recovery state
# where friction hurts most. Chain operators are the measured, high-frequency
# hole; substitution is narrower and is filed rather than papered over (OBS-185).

# --- T-3374 (OBS-423): env-prefix denylist ------------------------------------
#
# The T-1908 stripper below removes leading `NAME=VALUE` prefixes so the base
# command can be read. It stripped ANY name. That is fail-OPEN: the classifier
# decides SAFE from the base command AFTER stripping, while some of those
# prefixes are precisely what decides what that base name RESOLVES to.
#
# Measured before this fix, all four classified SAFE:
#     PATH=/tmp cat x            LD_PRELOAD=/tmp/e.so cat x
#     BASH_ENV=/tmp/e.sh cat x   IFS=x cat y
#
# A grep for these names in this file returned nothing — there was no denylist
# that missed them; the category was never represented. Sibling of OBS-422 in
# the same function, but the opposite direction: that one over-blocks reads,
# this one under-blocks writes.
#
# WHY A DENYLIST AND NOT A NAME ALLOWLIST. An allowlist (`FW_*` only) is
# strictly safer and was rejected deliberately: tests/unit/safe_commands_env_-
# prefix.bats pins `FOO=1 BAR=2 fw work-on T-X` as SAFE, a documented T-1908 /
# L-399 contract. Rewriting that test so this change could pass would be
# weakening a pinned contract to accommodate the fix. The denylist keeps every
# pinned contract green and still closes the measured hole. The residual — a
# denylist cannot cover a name nobody thought of — is real, is NOT claimed away,
# and the allowlist alternative is recorded as a Sovereign question in T-3374.
#
# FAILURE DIRECTION IS TOWARD BLOCKING, same idiom as the T-3096 wrapper loop:
# on a denied name the strip loop STOPS, leaving `NAME=VALUE` as the first word,
# which matches no case arm, so the line gates. This function can only ever
# REFUSE something that previously passed; it cannot admit anything.

# call is a cost with no benefit).
#
# ONE implementation, deliberately. The regex used to appear TWICE — once here
# and once re-entered inside the T-3096 wrapper loop, which is what makes
# `env PATH=/tmp cat x` a distinct bypass from `PATH=/tmp cat x`. Two copies of
# a security predicate is two chances to fix only one; the duplication is
# removed rather than the denylist being pasted into both.
# T-3454: the loop also consumes a leading `time` keyword. `time` changes
# nothing about what resolves or what executes — it reports how long the
# remainder took — but an unstripped `time` made the whole line unclassifiable,
# so the gate refused it as "writes nothing the gate can detect". The effect was
# perverse rather than merely inconvenient: MEASURING the cost of an otherwise
# permitted command required a wrapper that turned it into a refusal, so the
# pressure ran against measuring. That is a bad direction for a framework whose
# repeated failure mode is acting on unmeasured cost (T-3450, T-3451, L-621).
#
# Safe for the same reason the NAME=VALUE strip is safe: stripping only ever
# exposes the REMAINDER to the identical classification, and write detection
# (has_bash_write_pattern) runs against the ORIGINAL, unstripped line at every
# call site. `time rm -rf x` strips to `rm -rf x`, which is still a write and
# still blocked. Interleaving is handled because both forms are consumed by the
# same loop, so `time FOO=1 git status` and `FOO=1 time git status` behave alike.

# T-3221: is this command a COMMIT CHECKPOINT, as opposed to a command that
# merely mentions one?
#
# Two branches in check-active-task.sh admit a Bash command on the strength of
# it being a `git commit` — the T-2054 null-focus branch (a completed task must
# still be able to commit its own file-move) and the T-3179 partial-complete
# branch. Both rationales are correct: a commit persists work already produced
# under the Write/Edit gate, so it is not new work.
#
# Both tested whether the command CONTAINED the words, against the raw
# unstripped string, unanchored to any clause:
#
#     [[ "$BASH_CMD" =~ (^|[[:space:]])git[[:space:]]+commit($|[[:space:]]) ]]
#
# Measured against the live hook with focus null, that admitted (T-3221):
#
#     git commit -m "…" ; rm -rf /tmp/x          every clause, past every gate
#     git commit -m "…" | tee f                  a write the gate had FLAGGED

#                                                because a quoted ARGUMENT said so
#     git commit -m "$(cat /etc/hostname)"       arbitrary substitution
#
# The accident that makes this hard to see: `echo "git commit" > f` was blocked,

# precede the word inside the quotes. Correctness was punctuation luck.
#
# Reported by peer 832-Workflow-designer (their T-638) and confirmed in-tree
# here before acting. This is L-547 (T-2834) once more — a fast-path exemption
# classifying part of a command instead of the whole of it — keyed on the quoted
# payload rather than the first word.
#
# COMPOSITION, not a hand-rolled list. Requiring every clause to be
# independently admissible via _fw_single_command_is_safe, OR to be the commit
# itself, is what keeps `git add -A && git commit -m "…"` working: that is the
# documented post-completion form, and `git add`'s admissibility lives in the
# shared allowlist. A hand-written "cd or git commit" pair would have broken it,
# and would drift from the allowlist the moment either changed.
#
# Every failure direction is toward BLOCKING: an unrecognised clause, an
# unbalanced quote, a substitution, or no commit clause at all all return 1,
# which sends the command to the task gate rather than past it.
# T-3222: does this SINGLE clause make curl/wget write a file?
#
# WHY THIS IS CLAUSE-SCOPED and not an extra pattern in has_bash_write_pattern,
# which is where the admission rule would otherwise suggest it belongs:
# has_bash_write_pattern scans the whole raw command string, so it already
# classifies `git commit -m "we no longer rm -rf the output dir"` as a WRITE —
# a MENTION in a commit message, treated as an action. Measured, and registered
# as OBS-356; it predates all of this. Adding curl to that scanner would have
# added another instance of the exact class this cluster of tasks exists to
# remove. Here the input is one clause, quote-stripped, with its base already
# extracted — so only a real invocation can match.
#
# The DESTINATION is the hazard, not the flag. `curl -o -` and `wget -O -`
# write to stdout and are safe; `wget -o LOG` writes a log file and is not.
#
# Failure direction is toward TREATING IT AS A WRITE, which blocks: an
# unparseable clause (unbalanced quote) returns 0 here, and an unrecognised
# spelling of an output flag falls into the catch-all cluster tests rather than
# out of them. Blocking sends the command to the task gate, which admits it
# whenever a task is active; admitting it skips every gate there is.

# T-3299: is this command a METADATA-ONLY `fw task update` — the shape the
# G-020 block message itself prescribes as the escape route?
#
# G-020 (check-active-task.sh, build-readiness gate) blocks everything that
# falls through to it while the focused build task has placeholder ACs — and
# its own printed remedy, `fw task update T-XXX --type inception`, fell
# through with everything else: `update` is not a safe-listed task sub-verb,
# and no earlier checkpoint admits it. The gate quoted the remedy back
# verbatim while refusing it (OBS-353, measured 2026-08-29). Sibling of
# L-399/T-1890, one notch worse: there the bypass was rejected downstream;
# here the gate rejects its own prescription before anything downstream runs.
#
# NARROW BY CONSTRUCTION. A clause qualifies only when its argv is exactly
# `fw task update`, ONE task id, and flags drawn from the metadata set the
# gate's remedies need: --type/-t, --horizon, --status/-s, --reason/-r (each
# consuming the next token as its value) and bare --switch-focus (the T-1890
# sentinel update-task.sh consumes silently). Anything else — --add-tag,
# --owner, --skip-*, a second task id, an unrecognised token — disqualifies
# the clause and the command falls through to the gate as before.
#
# NO `=`-ATTACHED FORMS (`--type=inception`). update-task.sh's parser takes
# values as the NEXT argv token only; admitting a form the downstream parser
# rejects with "Unknown option" would be the exact T-1890 parity break this
# fix exists to close, from the other direction.
#
# Values must be UNQUOTED single tokens. _fw_strip_quoted deletes quoted
# content, so a double-quoted value leaves a valueless flag and the clause is
# refused — toward blocking, which every failure direction here is: command
# substitution, an unbalanced quote, a write pattern on the stripped view, an
# unrecognised flag, and a missing value all return 1, sending the command to
# the gate rather than past it.
#
# Same composition as is_commit_checkpoint_command below, for the same reason:
# chained clauses (`cd … && bin/fw task update …`) are admitted only when every
# other clause is independently safe via the SHARED allowlist, so this cannot
# drift from it.
#
# CONSUMED AT EXACTLY ONE CHECKPOINT — the G-020 block branch in
# check-active-task.sh — per that file's SAFE_ALLOWED argument (:269): a
# predicate honoured at one site fails toward blocking if the site is ever
# lost; one honoured at many fails toward permitting when one forgets. The
# drift gate (T-1730) runs BEFORE that branch, so a metadata update naming a
# task other than the focus is still blocked (or Tier-2 logged) upstream.
