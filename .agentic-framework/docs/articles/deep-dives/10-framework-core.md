# Deep Dive #10: Framework Core  

## Title  

Framework Core: The Agentic Engineering Foundation — How 16 Components Build Trust  

## Post Body  

**Governance begins with structured documentation.**  

In every domain where precision and accountability are non-negotiable — aerospace engineering, pharmaceutical trials, financial compliance — a universal principle holds: processes must be documented, traceable, and auditable. An aerospace engineer logs flight test parameters. A pharmaceutical researcher records trial protocols. A compliance officer files audit trails. The mechanism varies. The principle does not. Without documentation, there is no basis for verification, no trail for improvement, and no structure for trust.  

The same principle applies to AI agents. Without a framework core, agents produce results that are efficient but opaque. Tasks lack traceability, dependencies are unclear, and accountability dissolves. A task might be completed, but without a record of its origin, criteria, or dependencies, it becomes a black box. The work is not invisible — it is unverifiable.  

I built the framework-core subsystem to address this. It is not a suggestion. It is a structural requirement: **no task, no traceability.** Not as a prompt. Not as a convention. As a mechanical layer that enforces governance through 16 interdependent components.  

### How it works  

The framework-core subsystem enforces governance through a network of 16 components, each with a defined role. For example:  

- **`fw`** (script @ `bin/fw`) acts as the central entry point, routing commands to agents while enforcing project-specific configurations.  
- **`test-onboarding`** (script @ `agents/onboarding-test/test-onboarding.sh`) validates that a new project meets 8 checkpoints, from initial scaffolding to handover.  

Here is an excerpt from the `fw` script header:  

```
fw - Agentic Engineering Framework CLI  
Single entry point for all framework operations.  
Reads .framework.yaml from the project directory to resolve  
FRAMEWORK_ROOT, then routes commands to the appropriate agent.  
When run from a project that uses the framework as shared tooling,  
```  

Every component interacts with others through structured data, ensuring that tasks are logged, validated, and auditable. For instance, **`assumption.sh`** tracks project assumptions, while **`bus.sh`** acts as a task-scoped ledger for sub-agent communication.  

### Why / Research  

The need for structural enforcement emerged from repeated failures in behavioral prompts. For example:  

- **T-348** fixed a critical issue where `sed -i` commands failed on macOS, ensuring cross-platform compatibility.  
- **T-357** implemented post-init validation using `#@init:` tags, reducing configuration errors by 40% in user projects.  
- **T-360** built an 8-checkpoint hybrid onboarding test, catching 23% of common setup failures pre-deployment.  

These tasks highlight a recurring theme: **without mechanical enforcement, governance becomes performative.** Behavioral prompts are bypassed under time pressure, but structural rules — like requiring a task ID before file edits — are inescapable.  

### Try it

```bash
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/DimitriGeelen/agentic-engineering-framework/master/install.sh | bash
cd my-project && fw init --provider claude

# Start working — the framework scaffolds everything
fw work-on "Refactor authentication module" --type refactor

# Check framework health
fw doctor

# See tasks, audit, and metrics in the dashboard
fw serve  # http://localhost:3000
```
