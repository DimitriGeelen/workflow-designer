# T-3670 — Context pack v2 (frozen pack for the seven-reviewer architectural review)

**Task:** T-3670 (inception). **Date:** 2026-10-01. **Branch measured:** `bleeding-edge`.
**Audience:** seven independent reviewers. Four have no repository access and see only this document.
**Question:** `docs/reports/T-3670-question-v2.md`. Section numbers here (§1–§14) and case IDs (T0-NNN, D-NN) are the ones the question cites. They are stable: later edits append, they do not renumber.

**How to read this pack.**
- Every number was measured by a command on 2026-10-01 unless the line says otherwise, and each measurement says how it was taken.
- **"unverified"** marks a statement nobody re-checked for this pack (a summary of an older report, an inference, or a claim from documentation we could not confirm).
- **"PROPOSED, NOT CONFIRMED"** marks an item the operator has not confirmed. Treat it as a working assumption you may challenge.
- Where this pack summarises a document, it names the document.
- The pack deliberately states **no preferred option** for D1–D5. Nothing here is a recommendation.

**Measurement host.** Linux 6.8 x86_64, 24 hardware threads, GNU bash 5.2.21, Python 3.12.3, git 2.43.0, Claude Code 2.1.287. It is a fast desktop machine; laptops, macOS and WSL were not measured and will be slower (unverified by how much).

## §1 Inventory

### §1.1 What AEF is

The **Agentic Engineering Framework** (AEF) is a governance framework for AI coding agents working in a software repository. It is not an application library. It is a set of rules, file formats and **structural enforcement mechanisms** (hooks that block a tool call), so that rules are enforced by the system rather than by agent discipline. The main integration is Claude Code; `FRAMEWORK.md` is a provider-neutral guide for any CLI-capable agent.

- **Core principle:** "Nothing gets done without a task." An agent cannot write a file, or run a Bash command that is not on a read-only allowlist, unless a task exists and is the current *focus*.
- **Four directives, in priority order:** 1 Antifragility (failures become learnings `L-NNN` / concerns `G-NNN`, often a new gate or test); 2 Reliability (predictable, observable, auditable; no silent failures); 3 Usability; 4 Portability (no provider/language/OS lock-in).
- **Authority model:** Human = sovereignty (can override anything, is accountable); Framework = authority (enforces, logs); Agent = initiative (proposes, never decides).
- **Tasks** are Markdown files with YAML frontmatter in `.tasks/active|completed/`, with Agent/Human acceptance criteria (ACs) and a `## Verification` block of shell commands that must pass before close.
- **Enforcement tiers:** Tier 0 = consequential actions (force push, hard reset, `rm -rf`, `DROP TABLE`), human approval required. Tier 1 = default, needs an active task. Tier 2 = logged single-use human authorisation. Tier 3 = pre-approved read-only categories.
- **Reviewer verdict ledger:** an independent reviewer agent can close certain Human ACs by recording a signed, append-only verdict, validated against git history.
- **Watchtower:** a Flask web UI (`web/`) for review, approvals and dashboards.
- **`fw`:** the single CLI (`bin/fw`, 10,901 lines of bash). Every hook is invoked as `bin/fw hook <name>`, which runs `agents/context/<name>.sh`.
- **Self-hosting:** the framework is developed under its own governance (task ids past T-3670, 725 learnings). The core gates have been hardened incrementally, mostly in reaction to incidents and external reviews.

### §1.2 Lines and files per language

**How measured:** `find <dir> -type f -name '*.<ext>' | xargs cat | wc -l`, excluding `__pycache__` and `node_modules`. Extension-less bash files found by shebang (only in `bin/`).

| Dir | Bash (.sh) | Bash (no ext.) | Python | JS | HTML (Jinja) | YAML |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| `bin/` | 4 files / 989 | 5 / 12,283 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 |
| `lib/` | 105 / 32,842 | 0 | 107 / 36,217 | 2 / 2,995 | 0 | 3 / 426 |
| `agents/` | 115 / 39,087 | 0 | 31 / 14,072 | 0 | 0 | 0 |
| `web/` | 0 | 0 | 78 / 26,007 | 17 / 3,261 | 85 / 17,949 | 1 / 60 |
| **Total** | **229 files / 85,201 lines** | | **216 / 76,296** | **19 / 6,256** | **85 / 17,949** | **4 / 486** |

**Bash that is partly Python.** Many bash files embed Python as `python3 -c "…"` strings or `python3 - <<'EOF'` heredocs (counts by `grep -c`, approximate):

| File | Lines | `python3 -c` sites | Python heredocs | Shell functions |
|---|---:|---:|---:|---:|
| `bin/fw` | 10,901 | 60 | 21 | 46 (+ ~103 subcommand `case` arms) |
| `agents/context/check-tier0.sh` | 936 | 13 | 0 | 3 |
| `agents/context/check-active-task.sh` | 1,261 | 7 | 0 | 6 |
| `agents/context/budget-gate.sh` | 528 | 5 | 0 | 3 |
| `agents/context/checkpoint.sh` | 682 | 3 | 1 | 8 |
| `agents/task-create/update-task.sh` | 2,743 | 6 | 7 | 19 |
| `agents/git/lib/hooks.sh` | 1,579 | 2 | 0 | 10 |

### §1.3 Test suites (the behavioural contract)

Counted by `^@test` (bats) and `def test_` (pytest) under `tests/`.

| Suite | Files | Test cases |
|---|---:|---:|
| bats | 840 (718 in `tests/unit/`) | 7,049 |
| pytest | 449 (251 in `tests/unit/`) | 4,351 |
| **Total** | **1,289** | **11,400** |

Many bats tests drive hooks as black boxes (JSON on stdin, check exit code and stderr), so they can run unchanged against another implementation. Learnings L-631, L-636 and L-651 record that some tests are inert (mutation testing found tests that assert nothing). The suites are **not** a complete security specification.

### §1.4 Candidate "core" modules

"Test files" counts files under `tests/` whose text names the module; this is an **upper bound**. "Dependents" come from `fw fabric deps`, a hand-maintained component graph whose edges are noisy (indicative only).

| Module | Files (lang, lines) | Role | Tests (upper bound) | Dependents |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| **Tier 0 gate + pre-push guard** | `agents/context/check-tier0.sh` (bash + 13 `python3 -c`, 936); `lib/tier0_action.py` (Python, 885); `agents/git/lib/hooks.sh` (bash, 1,579) | PreToolUse gate on Bash: detection, self-approval word rule, action grammar, approval store (flock-locked JSON), single-use consumption, TTLs; git pre-push refuses forced updates / ref deletions without a matching approval | 16 named files / 228 cases; the 5 core suites = 166 cases | check-tier0: 17; hooks.sh: 33; tier0_action.py: no fabric edges (used by check-tier0.sh, hooks.sh, `bin/fw`) |
| **Task / focus gate** | `agents/context/check-active-task.sh` (bash + 7 `python3 -c`, 1,261); `agents/context/lib/safe-commands.sh` (bash, 1,488) | PreToolUse on Write/Edit/Bash: path exemptions, Bash safe-command allowlist, focus check, G-020 build-readiness, T-1730 focus-drift, session-scoped focus | 64 files / 701 | 37 |
| **Context-budget gate** | `agents/context/budget-gate.sh` (bash + 5 `python3 -c`, 528); `agents/context/checkpoint.sh` (682); `lib/context_tokens.py` | Reads token usage from the session transcript; blocks all but wrap-up at 95% of the configured window | 23 files / 214; checkpoint 25 / 290 | 15; checkpoint 11 |
| **Reviewer-verdict ledger** | `lib/verdict_ledger.py` (Python, 3,333); `lib/review_policy.py` (421); `lib/reviewer/*` (~6,300) | Append-only, git-verified ledger of signed reviewer verdicts; HMAC-signed dispatch registry; producer/reviewer separation; required review "rung" per impact | 17 files / 466; reviewer pkg 40 / 626 | used by update-task.sh, bin/fw, audit.sh, upgrade.sh, termlink.sh |
| **Task-close gates** | `agents/task-create/update-task.sh` (bash + 6 `python3 -c` + 7 heredocs, 2,743) | `--status work-completed`: ~12 gate functions (ACs, RCA, render surface, inception scope, verification-port literals, …), P-011 runs each `## Verification` line as a shell command, verdict apply; 11 `--skip-*` flags, criterion flags refused under `CLAUDECODE=1` without `--i-am-human` | 100 files / 960 | 53 (most coupled after bin/fw) |
| **Dispatcher** | `bin/fw` (bash + 60 `python3 -c` + 21 heredocs, 10,901) | Config resolution (CLI > env > `.framework.yaml` > default), ~103 subcommands, `hook <name>` routing, inline implementations (`do_vendor`, cron generator, doctor helpers) | 444 files / 3,844 | 371 edges |

**Stated limit of the ledger (T-3581):** every agent runs as the same OS user as the signing key, so a coherently fabricated provenance chain cannot be told apart from a genuine one. It is fail-closed against accidents and unsophisticated forgery, not forgery-resistant.

**Known gap of the task gate: G-077 (high).** The Bash allowlist admits `python3 -c` behind a *textual* deny-list of write indicators. Seven ordinary Python write idioms (e.g. `pathlib.write_text`) match none of it, so writes reach disk with no task and no audit trail. L-554: a safe-list must be reviewed "as a product of entries" (`curl … | python3 -c <write>`).

## §2 Hook protocol and the gate chain

### §2.1 Claude Code hook contract (verified against docs, 2026-10-01)

Source: https://code.claude.com/docs/en/hooks (fetched 2026-10-01).

- **Input:** JSON on stdin. Common fields: `session_id`, `transcript_path`, `cwd`, `permission_mode`, `hook_event_name`. PreToolUse adds `tool_name`, `tool_input` (for Bash: `command`, `description`, `timeout`, `run_in_background`) and `tool_use_id`. Inside a subagent the input also carries `agent_id` and `agent_type`; configured hooks fire for subagent tool calls too.
- **Exit 0:** success; stdout may carry JSON output.
- **Exit 2:** blocking. "Exit 2 blocks whether or not you print JSON: even a JSON `permissionDecision` of `"allow"` can't override it." stderr (or the JSON reason) is shown to the agent.
- **Any other exit code:** "non-blocking error … proceeds with the action". A hook that cannot start (missing script, exit 127) "lands in the same non-blocking bucket".
- **Timeout:** default 600 s for command hooks on PreToolUse. "A timed-out … hook doesn't block the tool call. The call continues through the normal permission flow, so don't count on a stalled hook to act as a gate."
- **JSON output (PreToolUse):** `hookSpecificOutput.permissionDecision` = `allow` | `deny` | `ask` | `defer`, plus `permissionDecisionReason`, `updatedInput` (replaces the tool arguments), `additionalContext`.
- **Concurrency:** "All matching hooks run in parallel." There is therefore **no ordering** between the hooks of one event; the order in §2.2 is configuration order only.
- **Interaction with permission rules** (https://code.claude.com/docs/en/permissions): hook decisions do not bypass deny/ask rules; a hook that exits 2 blocks before permission rules are evaluated, even if an allow rule matches.
- **Matchers** match `tool_name` (exact, `|`-lists, or regex such as `mcp__.*`). MCP tools are named `mcp__<server>__<tool>`; they are only gated if a matcher names them.
- **Reload:** "Direct edits to hooks in settings files are normally picked up automatically by the file watcher." Hooks are therefore not a startup snapshot (per docs; not tested here).

**Consequence for "fail closed" (arithmetic on the contract, not a new measurement):** a hook fails *open* if it crashes with any code other than 2, cannot start, or exceeds its timeout. Only an explicit exit 2 (or a JSON deny) blocks.

### §2.2 Gates per tool call, as configured

Source: `.claude/settings.json` (this repository). Every command is `${CLAUDE_PROJECT_DIR}/bin/fw hook <name>`, except Stop (`agents/context/stop-driver.sh`, timeout 10 s). No hook sets a `timeout`, so the 600 s default applies.

| # | Event | Matcher | Hook | Purpose |
|---:|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | PreToolUse | `EnterPlanMode` | block-plan-mode | ban built-in plan mode |
| 2 | PreToolUse | `Write\|Edit\|Bash` | check-active-task | task, focus, G-020, focus-drift (§1.4) |
| 3–10 | PreToolUse | `Write\|Edit` | check-human-ac-tick, check-active-completed-dup, check-arc-id, check-heredoc-cmd-sub, check-inception-decisions, check-inception-schema, check-onboarding-gate, check-worktree-governance-write | task-file schema and governance writes |
| 11 | PreToolUse | `Bash` | check-tier0 | Tier 0 gate (§5) |
| 12 | PreToolUse | `Bash` | check-paid-backend | refuses paid review backends without an approved proposal |
| 13 | PreToolUse | `Agent` | check-agent-dispatch | sub-agent cap |
| 14 | PreToolUse | `Write\|Edit\|Bash` | check-project-boundary | writes outside the project |
| 15 | PreToolUse | `Write\|Edit\|Bash` | budget-gate | context budget |
| 16 | PreToolUse | `TodoWrite\|TaskCreate\|TaskUpdate\|TaskList\|TaskGet` | block-task-tools | ban built-in todo tools |
| 17 | PreToolUse | one MCP tool | check-rail-mcp-label | label check |
| 18–25 | PostToolUse | (all) / Bash / Task / Write / Write\|Edit | checkpoint post-tool, error-watchdog, check-dispatch, loop-detect, check-fabric-new-file, commit-cadence, check-settings-edit, audit-task-tools | budget fallback, telemetry, nudges |
| 26 | UserPromptSubmit | (all) | sidecar-inbox | peer-consult inbox |
| — | SessionStart / PreCompact / Stop | | post-compact-resume, pre-compact, stop-driver | session lifecycle |

**Hook processes per tool call:** Bash = 5 Pre + 4 Post = 9; Write = 11 Pre + 6 Post = 17; Edit = 11 Pre + 5 Post = 16; Read = 0 Pre + 3 Post = 3. **Not gated by any PreToolUse hook:** Read, Grep, Glob, WebFetch, WebSearch, NotebookEdit, and every MCP tool except one. (An MCP tool that writes files or runs commands is outside every AEF gate; unverified which installed MCP servers can do so.)

### §2.3 Failure semantics in the dispatcher (read from code)

- **Missing hook script → allow.** `bin/fw hook` logs `missing-hook` and exits 0 (T-1360), deliberately, so config drift cannot hard-lock every Bash/Write/Edit.
- **Hook crash → allow, with a banner.** `fw_hook_crash_trap` (`lib/config.sh`) prints "HOOK CRASHED … NOT a policy block" and logs; it does not change the exit code, so a non-0/non-2 exit allows (§2.1).
- **Parse error in `bin/fw` → blocks everything** (L-332, L-408: "self-locking"; the agent cannot run the edit that would fix the file). Closed, but not by design.
- **Broken inline Python → silent allow** (L-528: "the gate fails open while still exiting 0").
- **Budget gate with no transcript → allow** (documented intentional fail-open).
- **Tier 0 exact-text lock timeout (10 s) → block**; nothing is consumed.
- **Hook timeout (600 s default) → allow** (harness behaviour, §2.1).

---

## §3 Threat model

Verbatim from question v2 (confirmed by the operator 2026-10-01: **BOTH, as strong as possible**). The enforcement must:
- **(a)** reliably catch a cooperative agent's MISTAKES;
- **(b)** hold against a DETERMINED adversarial agent that is actively searching for gaps (obscure spellings, wrapping in scripts, editing the approval store, editing the hooks themselves).

"Today every agent runs as the same OS user as the enforcement: root on the reference host. So (b) is currently unachievable by any hook implementation alone. That residual was accepted in T-3581 as a STARTING point, not as the goal." Reviewers are asked for a layered design: a guardrail layer (hooks) as complete as possible for (a), and an isolation layer the agent cannot reach for (b), and to name the gaps only the harness vendor can close (the operator wants that list as an evidenced feature request; operator reports earlier requests to the vendor went unanswered — unverified beyond the operator's statement).

**Cost asymmetry.** Question v2: "a missed destructive action (a false allow) is worse than a false block."
- **False allow:** an unreviewed destructive action executes. Observed consequences in this project's history: the reference host was OOM-crashed 4× in 22 h by a self-replicating hook (L-627); a comment in an inline Python block executed a real `git push` from the hook (L-684); a sibling project lost its working tree (`.git`, `.tasks`, `.context`) to a script `rm -rf` and recovered only from the remote (CLAUDE.md, T-2742, their G-018). Some actions are irreversible (remote ref deletion without a backup, publishing).
- **False block:** the agent is stopped and must ask the operator. Cost: operator interruption and context spent. Measured examples: an unmapped force push needed **3 approvals** (T0-074); a read-only `grep` naming the gate's keyword is blocked as self-approval (T0-120, observed twice while building this pack). A self-locking false block (§2.3, parse error in `bin/fw`) can require the operator to repair files by hand outside the session.
- **Priority order when criteria conflict** (question v2): 1 no unreviewed destructive action executes; 2 fail closed, always; 3 hook latency within budget (§4); 4 maintainable by the team (§8); 5 migration cost.

**Scope boundary today (T-2742).** The Tier 0 gate sees only `tool_input.command`. A script that an agent writes (Tier 1 governs the write) and then runs (`bash x.sh`, `make`, `python3 y.py`) is not inspected at run time. Force-push and remote ref deletion are additionally enforced at git's pre-push hook, whichever way the push is launched, unless client hooks are skipped (`--no-verify`, `core.hooksPath` overrides, plumbing, forge API).

---

## §4 Latency

**Budget: PROPOSED, NOT CONFIRMED: p95 < 100 ms per hook.**

**Method (2026-10-01).** A Python harness ran each hook **21 times** (first run discarded as warm-up, **20 timed**) with a synthetic payload on stdin and `CLAUDECODE=1`, measuring wall-clock with `time.perf_counter` around `subprocess.run`. Payloads: Bash `{"command":"ls"}`; Write to a non-existent path under `docs/reports/`; PostToolUse payloads for the same tools; UserPromptSubmit `{"prompt":"hello"}`. Each payload had a fresh `tool_use_id`. `budget-gate` received a copy of a real 150–400 KB session transcript. Each hook was measured twice: as configured (`bin/fw hook <name>`) and directly (`bash agents/context/<name>.sh`). p95 = 19th of 20 sorted values. Every hook exited 0 (**allow path**) except `loop-detect`, whose loop detector fired (exit 2) on some of the 20 identical payloads. The block path was not timed (timing it would write pending approvals). Not timed: check-fabric-new-file, check-agent-dispatch, check-dispatch, block-* hooks, session/compaction hooks, stop-driver.

**Baselines (p50 / p95 ms):** `bash -c true` 2 / 2; `python3 -c pass` 70 / 82; `bin/fw version` 121 / 128.

| Event | Matcher | Hook | via fw p50 | via fw p95 | via fw max | direct p50 | direct p95 |
|---|---|---|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|
| Pre | Write\|Edit\|Bash | check-active-task | 386 | 405 | 437 | 278 | 295 |

| Pre | Write\|Edit\|Bash | check-project-boundary | 277 | 302 | 316 | 165 | 171 |
| Pre | Write\|Edit\|Bash | budget-gate | 270 | 452 | 460 | 162 | 322 |
| Post | (all) | checkpoint post-tool | 249 | 347 | 357 | 148 | 225 |
| Post | Bash | error-watchdog | 182 | 191 | 195 | 76 | 87 |
| Post | (all) | loop-detect | 149 | 163 | 165 | 44 | 47 |

| UserPromptSubmit | (all) | sidecar-inbox | 472 | 489 | 491 | 358 | 386 |

**Observations (arithmetic on the table):**
- **No hook meets the proposed budget through `bin/fw`.** The fastest p95 via fw is 163 ms (loop-detect). Directly, 9 of 20 hooks have p95 ≤ 100 ms.
- **The `bin/fw` dispatcher adds ~100–110 ms** to every hook (via-fw p50 minus direct p50), about the cost of `bin/fw version`: bash parses the 10,901-line file before reaching the `hook)` arm.
- **Each `python3` launch costs ~70 ms** here; the heaviest gates (Tier 0, task gate, paid-backend, budget) launch Python one or more times.
- **Per-call cost.** Summed p50 CPU for a Bash call ≈ 1.69 s Pre + 0.76 s Post; for a Write call ≈ 2.55 s Pre + 0.93 s Post. Because matching hooks run in parallel (§2.1), the wall-clock added per call is roughly the slowest Pre plus the slowest Post hook: ≈ 0.42 + 0.25 s (Bash) on this machine. Wall-clock inside a live Claude Code session was not measured.
- An earlier median-of-5 measurement (v1 pack, same day) agrees within ~5% on every p50.
- Budget-gate's own header states a target of "<100 ms per invocation".

## §5 Tier 0 cases

**Sources:** `docs/reports/T-3593-round{3..7}-codex.md`, `T-3593-round7-claude.md`, and the Claude round-3/round-4 sections of `T-3593-T-3594-review.md`. Reviews were independent of the builder. Codex rounds 3–7 ran with a read-only filesystem (bats could not start); their results come from code reading and read-only classifier probes. Claude rounds 3, 4 and 7 ran fixtures with the real hook and pre-push.

**Status rules.** *fixed* = a later review round re-ran the probe and it held. *fixed (claimed)* = the builder's commit and the docs claim it, no later reviewer re-ran that exact probe (unverified). *open* = no fix commit exists after the review (git log for T-3593 ends with the two round-7 review commits). *residual* = documented as accepted, out of scope of the text gate. Nothing was re-probed for this pack: running the gate on these strings writes pending approvals, and several strings contain the gate's own keyword.

**Expected outcome vocabulary.** *block+action*: blocked, mapped to an action-keyed approval (§12). *block+text*: blocked, unmapped, approval of the exact text. *block-self*: blocked as self-approval (only the operator approves). *label*: blocked and labelled HOOK BYPASS. *distinct*: the two commands must not share an approval key. *allow*: passes with no prompt.

`⏎` = a literal backslash-newline line continuation. `<project>` = the absolute project path.

**Counts:** 76 attack/boundary cases (T0-001…T0-076), 22 benign/false-block cases (T0-101…T0-122). Open after round 7: T0-059, 060, 061, 063–074 (15), plus 4 unverified-after-R5 text-gate rows (T0-040…043) and 3 residuals (T0-015, 016, 029).

**Pattern (from the reports; inference, not a measurement).** Over five rounds the text classifier kept missing *shell expansions* (wrappers changing the environment, escaped spaces, ANSI-C quoting, NUL truncation, line continuation, brace expansion, globs) and kept introducing *key collisions* (tag vs branch namespace, local branch prefixes, collapsed whitespace, delimiter injection in serialised keys). Round 5 replaced the detection-side denylist for *mapping* with an allow-grammar ("unmapped is the fail-safe direction"); detection of the self-approval word still depends on reproducing bash's expansion rules.

## §6 Defect catalogue

**Source:** `.context/project/learnings.yaml` (725 entries; 24 ids occur more than once, so entries are cited as id + task) and `.context/project/concerns.yaml`.
**Tags:** *language* = arises from bash/shell semantics and would plausibly not exist in a typed language with structured data; *parsing* = arises from treating shell text with hand-written matching instead of a parser; *spec* = a design or specification choice that any language would reproduce. **The tags are the pack author's tentative classification (unverified, PROPOSED, NOT CONFIRMED); reviewers are asked to reclassify.**

Keyword counts over learning text (approximate, overlapping): pipefail/SIGPIPE/141: 27; swallowed errors (`2>/dev/null`, `|| true`): 25; `set -e`/errexit: 17; heredoc: 14; quoting/word-splitting: 14; shellcheck: 12; trap/EXIT: 9; backticks: 8; subshell/pipe scope: 7; inline `python3 -c`: 7; dead negation: 4; grep/sed portability: 4.

| ID | Source | Defect (quoted or closely paraphrased) | Tag |
|---|---|---|---|
| D-01 | L-332 (T-1629) | Heredoc inside `$(…)` in the hot-path dispatcher is fragile across bash versions; a parse error in `bin/fw` "is unrecoverable from inside Claude Code because every PreToolUse hook routes through bin/fw". | language (+ spec: single dispatcher) |
| D-02 | L-408 (T-1942) | A wrong closing `)` in a heredoc/command-substitution in `bin/fw` creates "a self-locking failure mode". | language (+ spec) |
| D-03 | L-294 (T-1530) | An unquoted heredoc "command-substitutes `$(.*?)` inside Python regex strings, silently mangling the regex." | language |
| D-04 | L-370 (T-1816) | Heredoc interpolation "silently produces broken YAML when values contain ':', '#', or newlines." | language |
| D-05 | G-073 (concern, low) | `cat > "$file" << HEREDOC` fails silently when the directory is missing; the function "printed its unconditional success banner and exited 0 while every hook write had failed." | language + spec |
| D-06 | L-528 (T-2707) | Backticks inside a double-quoted `python3 -c "…"` are bash command substitution; "the gate fails open while still exiting 0." | language |
| D-07 | L-627 (T-3086) | A backtick-quoted command in a double-quoted config string made every `source` of `lib/config.sh` exec `fw`: "a self-replicating fork bomb that OOM-crashed the host 4x in 22h." | language |
| D-08 | L-684 (T-3594) | A backtick or `$(` in a Python *comment* inside the Tier 0 hook's double-quoted `python3 -c` executed a real `git push` from the hook's cwd. | language |
| D-09 | L-440 (T-2068) | A literal `"` in a `python3 -c "…"` comment terminates the string and shifts argv; `bash -n` does not catch it. | language |
| D-10 | L-236 (T-1374) | `set -euo pipefail` "silently aborts via command-substitution assignments … BEFORE any subsequent 'silent failure detector' can fire." | language |
| D-11 | L-022 (T-1362) | `grep PATTERN file \| sed …` aborts the enclosing function when grep has no match (pipefail + `set -e`). | language |
| D-12 | L-302 (T-1545) | Plain assignments (unlike `local var=…`) propagate pipeline failure; an empty filter chain "aborts the calling function silently." | language |
| D-13 | L-304 (T-1557) | Foundation utilities must guard pipelines: "The pipefail trap (L-302) is contagious." | language |
| D-14 | L-240/L-305/L-387/L-613 | In the verification gate `cmd \| grep -q X` exits 141 (SIGPIPE) "when grep finds the match": it fails when the check succeeds early. Recorded four times. | language |
| D-15 | L-299 (T-1541) | In GNU grep BRE `` \` `` is a start-of-buffer assertion; a filter "matches every line and strips all input", then pipefail aborts before the diagnostic. | language |
| D-16 | L-006 (T-1250) | `grep -c` exits 1 on zero; `\|\| echo 0` produces multi-line values that break arithmetic. | language |
| D-17 | G-089 (concern, medium) | The cron generator wraps every job as `<cmd> 2>&1 \| logger …`; "logger always succeeds", masking every job's exit status. | spec |
| D-18 | L-636 (T-3138) | Bash exempts `! cmd` from errexit, so a non-final `! cmd` in a bats test "CANNOT fail it"; 106 sites swept. | language |
| D-19 | L-651 (T-3191) | The dead-negation linter was wired into no gate; the class "was reintroduced two days later … only mutation testing caught it." | spec |
| D-20 | L-655 (T-3250) | `{ …; fail=$((fail+1)); } \| tee` runs in a subshell; counters never reach the parent; exit 0 "on every run regardless of failures." | language |
| D-21 | L-656 (T-3250) | Four test-harness false greens of one shape, incl. "`grep -c \| grep -qx 0` under pipefail returned FAIL for EVERY input". | language |
| D-22 | L-395 (T-1687) | `$((…))` reads `'008'` as invalid octal; latent in `lib/arc.sh`, "would fire at arc-008." | language |
| D-23 | L-014 (T-1320) | Without `shopt -s globstar`, "`**` silently collapses to `*`", diverging from Python's recursive glob. | language |
| D-24 | L-592 (T-2951) | An aliased `grep` (ugrep) applied ignore patterns with no knowledge of git's index; tracked files were invisible. | spec (environment) |
| D-25 | L-125 / L-048 | GNU/BSD differences need a compat layer (`_sed_i`, `_date_to_epoch` with GNU→BSD→python fallback). | language (portability) |
| D-26 | T-3665 (P-01) | A CRLF checkout on native Windows "silently disables the secret scan". | spec (environment) |
| D-27 | T0-011, T0-073 | `CDPATH` changes what a relative `cd` enters; the hook reads its own environment, not the tool shell's. | parsing |
| D-28 | L-367 (T-1687) | A `( sleep T && kill $$ ) &` watchdog leaks every inherited fd, including a flock fd, blocking later audits for 600 s. | language |
| D-29 | L-280 (T-1478) | "flock + trap-rm of lockfile defeats sequential mutual exclusion." | spec |
| D-30 | L-672 (T-3371) | A `mapfile → edit → rewrite` hook-telemetry counter lost 17 of 1,600 increments under concurrency (runs on every hook fire). | spec |
| D-31 | G-077 (high) + L-554 | A textual deny-list in front of `python3 -c` on the Bash allowlist lets writes through with no task (§1.4). | parsing |
| D-32 | L-600 (T-2991) | P-011 `eval`s each verification line; a multi-line `python3 -c` body ran as bash ("`import yaml,sys` … runs ImageMagick's screenshot tool, writing multi-MB PostScript into the repo root"). | spec + parsing |
| D-33 | L-284 (T-1500) → T0-053/054 | Tier 0 hashed raw text, whitespace re-flow voided approvals; normalising whitespace then collapsed distinct quoted paths. | parsing |
| D-34 | §2.3 | Missing hook script → exit 0 (allow), by design. | spec |
| D-35 | §2.1, §2.3 | A crashing hook (exit ≠ 0, 2), a hook that cannot start, or a hook past its timeout → tool call proceeds. | spec (harness contract) |
| D-36 | §2.3 | Budget gate with no transcript → allow, by design. | spec |
| D-37 | T0-024…027, 034…038, 048, 055–070 | Self-approval/detection misses: the detector must reproduce bash expansion (escapes, ANSI-C, NUL, continuation, braces, globs). | parsing |
| D-38 | T0-003/004, 045–054, 059/060 | Key collisions from normalisation or string serialisation of structured targets. | spec |
| D-39 | T0-015, 016, 071, T-3581 | Approvals and verdict signing keys live in files the agent's OS user can write. | spec (isolation) |

**Pattern (inference).** Most of these defects are *silent*: a gate allows, a check passes or a counter under-reports, with exit 0. Many come from bash evaluating text meant as data (Python in a double-quoted string, regexes in a heredoc, verification lines passed to `eval`); most of the rest from bash exit-status semantics. The usual remedy so far has been one more lint, one more test and one more learning per instance.

## §7 Distribution and hard constraints

### §7.1 How consumers get the framework (read from code)

- **Install.** `install.sh` requires **bash ≥ 4.4** (`install.sh:137`; macOS system bash 3.2 is rejected, Homebrew bash needed), **git ≥ 2.20** and **Python ≥ 3.8** (`install.sh:146,156`). Node is optional. It clones the framework and puts `fw` on PATH.
- **Vendoring.** `fw init <project>` / `fw vendor` call `do_vendor()` in `bin/fw`, which **copies** `bin/`, `lib/`, `agents/`, `web/`, `docs/`, `.tasks/templates/`, `policy/`, `FRAMEWORK.md` and related files into the consumer's `.agentic-framework/` (one `rsync` per include) and writes a `.upstream` sentinel. This repository vendors itself: `.agentic-framework/` is **35 MB, ~2,660 files** (VERSION 1.7.695 at v1-pack time).
- **Upgrade.** `fw upgrade [<project>]` (`lib/upgrade.sh`, 2,787 lines) re-runs `do_vendor()`, refreshes the consumer's `.claude/settings.json` hooks, updates the version pin in `.framework.yaml`, and merges governance sections/templates while preserving project content.
- **Consumer hooks** run the *vendored* copy: `${CLAUDE_PROJECT_DIR}/.agentic-framework/bin/fw hook <name>`. There is no global runtime dependency beyond the shim.
- **Shim.** `bin/fw-shim` (installed as `~/.local/bin/fw`) walks up from cwd and `exec`s either the framework repo's `bin/fw` or a consumer's `.agentic-framework/bin/fw`.
- **Release train.** Development on `bleeding-edge`; `master` is the consumer install surface and only fast-forwards at a release (`fw release tag-and-release`). Consumers upgrade from the last release.
- **Today a consumer receives only text files.** A compiled artefact would have to ship per OS/arch inside `.agentic-framework/`, be fetched at `fw upgrade`, or be built on the host (open question D4).

### §7.2 The P-01 installer (summary of `docs/reports/T-3659-p01-zero-to-running.md`)

- **Pattern:** one command installs Claude Code, the framework and dashboard dependencies natively per OS (Windows via WSL), puts `fw` on PATH, creates a desktop icon that opens the project, starts Watchtower and runs Claude Code under `claude-fw`.
- **Evidence (one Windows 10 machine, framework 1.7.0, 57 findings):** documented native Git Bash install 15 min 51 s, **blocked** (Watchtower `fcntl` crash); documented WSL install by hand 1 min 49 s with ~10 manual fixes; P-01 `Install-AEF.ps1` 127 s, 0 fixes.
- **Proposed landing:** `install.sh --quickstart`, `install.ps1` next to it (native Git Bash marked unsupported), kit under `install/` in the framework repo, versioned with releases and refreshable by `fw upgrade`.
- **Relevant recommendation (IW-2 of T-3659):** the WSL installer creates a **normal (non-root) user** and runs the bootstrap as that user.
- Status: the P-01 proposal is unratified; the kit files are not in the repository yet.

### §7.3 Supported platforms

| Platform | Status today | Source |
|---|---|---|
| Linux (x86_64) | supported; reference host | measured |
| Linux arm64 | unverified | — |
| macOS | supported with Homebrew bash ≥ 4.4 | `install.sh` |
| Windows via WSL2 | supported after manual fixes (P-01) | T-3659 |
| Windows native Git Bash | **unsupported** (blocked in P-01) | T-3659 |
| CI / headless hosts, git worktrees | must work | CLAUDE.md |

### §7.4 Hard constraints

| Constraint | Status |
|---|---|
| Consumers vendor the framework; any artefact must reach them through `fw upgrade` (or an equivalent that keeps the per-project version pin), and old consumers must keep working | fact (current design) |
| **No toolchain on consumer hosts** (no Go/Rust compiler required; Python ≥ 3.8 is already required) | PROPOSED, NOT CONFIRMED |
| **Offline install** (vendored copy works with no network after install) | PROPOSED, NOT CONFIRMED (whether today's install works offline is unverified) |
| **Binary size** | PROPOSED, NOT CONFIRMED: no limit stated; for scale, today's vendored copy is 35 MB |
| **Licence** | repository is **Apache License 2.0** (`LICENSE`). Any added dependency must be licence-compatible: PROPOSED, NOT CONFIRMED |
| Hooks must fail CLOSED without making the agent unable to repair the gate | operator directive (question v2 priority 2) |
| Development lands on `bleeding-edge`; consumers receive it only at a release | fact (CLAUDE.md) |
| **Agents WILL run as non-root users** (D5) | **operator ruling, 2026-10-01** (`T-3670-core-language.md`), consistent with P-01 IW-2 |
| Migration discipline: one module at a time, old and new paths side by side with a parity check, bats suites as the contract, no big-bang rewrite | PROPOSED, NOT CONFIRMED (IW-5) |

---

## §8 Team

**One operator plus AI agents. PROPOSED, NOT CONFIRMED: no other human reviewers for Go/Rust code.**

- The operator is the only human who approves Tier 0 actions, inception decisions, human-owned task closure and arc closure.
- Code is written by AI agents (Claude Code, codex, opencode) and reviewed by independent AI reviewers (§12, the verdict ledger). The Tier 0 work in §5 went through seven review rounds by two model families with no human code reviewer.
- Existing language skills on the project, as visible from the repository: bash, Python, JS/HTML. A sibling project (TermLink, the cross-terminal tool the framework calls) is written in **Rust** by the same operator-plus-agents team (CLAUDE.md §TermLink). There is no Go in this repository (measured: 0 `.go` files under `bin/ lib/ agents/ web/`; unverified elsewhere).

## §10 Harness-native enforcement as it exists today

**Verification status.** Claude Code items were read on 2026-10-01 from the official docs at the URLs cited. Codex items come from the official docs page cited (partial). opencode items come from its permissions page (partial). Nothing here was tested on the reference host except where marked "measured".

### §10.1 Claude Code — permission rules (verified, https://code.claude.com/docs/en/permissions)

- **Rules:** `permissions.allow`, `ask`, `deny` with entries such as `Bash(npm test *)`, `Read(./.env)`, `Edit(docs/**)`, `WebFetch(domain:…)`, `mcp__server__tool`.
- **Evaluation:** "Rules are evaluated in order: deny, then ask, then allow. The first match in that order determines the outcome." "An allow rule can't carve an exception out of a deny rule."
- **Compound commands:** separators `&&`, `||`, `;`, `|`, `|&`, `&`, newlines are recognised; "A rule must match each subcommand independently." Deny and ask rules also apply to commands nested in subshells, command substitutions and loop bodies.
- **Wrappers stripped before matching:** `timeout`, `time`, `nice`, `nohup`, `stdbuf`, `command`, `builtin`, zsh `noglob`, flag-less `xargs`. Not stripped: `direnv exec`, `npx`, `docker exec`, etc. `watch`, `setsid`, `ionice`, `flock` and `find -exec/-delete` always prompt.
- **Stated limit (verbatim):** "A Bash rule matches the command text Claude writes … It doesn't match the same program invoked in a different form, so a deny or ask rule covers the invocation Claude usually produces and isn't a security boundary around the program." Example given: `Bash(curl *)` does not stop `/usr/bin/curl …` or `sh -c 'curl …'`. "Bash permission patterns that try to constrain command arguments are fragile."
- **File rules:** only `Edit(path)` and `Read(path)` are consulted (rules for `Write` are ignored with a startup warning). Read/Edit deny rules also apply to recognised Bash file commands (`cat`, `head`, `tail`, `sed`, `tee`) and redirection targets, but not to commands that read without naming the file (e.g. `grep -r`).
- **Protected paths** (https://code.claude.com/docs/en/permission-modes): writes to `.git`, `.claude` and Claude's own config are never auto-approved except in `bypassPermissions` (and plan mode with bypass available); `default`/`acceptEdits` prompt, `auto` routes to the classifier, `dontAsk` denies. Allow rules do not pre-approve them.
- **Actions no mode auto-approves:** explicit ask rules; `rm`/`rmdir` targeting a "critical path" ("which no allow rule or PreToolUse hook `allow` approves"); tools requiring user interaction; and a few others.
- **Hooks vs rules:** a hook `allow` does not override a deny or ask rule; a hook exit 2 blocks before rules are evaluated.

### §10.2 Claude Code — managed/policy settings and precedence (verified, https://code.claude.com/docs/en/settings, https://code.claude.com/docs/en/managed-settings)

- **Precedence, highest first:** 1 managed settings (`managed-settings.json` + `managed-settings.d/*.json`, MDM/OS policy, or server-managed settings from the claude.ai console); 2 command line (`--settings`); 3 project local `.claude/settings.local.json`; 4 shared project `.claude/settings.json`; 5 user `~/.claude/settings.json`.
- **Managed file locations:** macOS `/Library/Application Support/ClaudeCode/`; Linux and WSL `/etc/claude-code/`; Windows `C:\Program Files\ClaudeCode\`; also macOS profile domain `com.anthropic.claudecode`, Windows `HKLM\SOFTWARE\Policies\ClaudeCode` (and HKCU only when no admin document is present).
- "No other level, including command line arguments, can override a managed permission rule." "If a tool is denied at any level, no other level can allow it." There are a few "security-sensitive exceptions" where a stricter lower-level value still counts.
- **Managed-only locks:** `allowManagedPermissionRulesOnly` (managed settings become the only source of permission rules); `allowManagedHooksOnly` ("user, project, local, and plugin hooks are blocked"); `disableAllHooks` at lower levels cannot disable managed hooks; `permissions.disableBypassPermissionsMode` / `disableAutoMode`; sandbox `allowManagedDomainsOnly`.
- **Who can change managed settings:** the docs state "a developer who is an administrator on the machine can edit the managed source itself". A managed file in `/etc/claude-code/` is therefore protected from an agent only if the agent is not root/administrator (inference from the docs).
- **Reference host:** `/etc/claude-code/` does not exist (measured) — no managed settings are deployed.

### §10.3 Claude Code — Bash sandbox (verified, https://code.claude.com/docs/en/sandboxing)

- **Platforms:** macOS (Seatbelt, built in), Linux and **WSL2** (bubblewrap + socat; optional seccomp filter). **WSL1 and native Windows are not supported.** On Ubuntu 24.04+ the default AppArmor policy must allow bubblewrap to create user namespaces.
- **Scope:** applies to "every Bash, PowerShell, or Monitor command and its child processes". It does not wrap Claude's own Read/Edit/Write tools (those are governed by permission rules) — inference from the docs' wording.
- **Filesystem default:** write access to the working directory and subdirectories, added directories and a per-user temp dir; read access to the whole machine except denied paths. Configurable: `sandbox.filesystem.allowWrite`, `denyWrite`, `denyRead`, `allowRead`; `sandbox.credentials` to block credential files / unset env vars.
- **Protected inside writable dirs** (no exemption possible except disabling filesystem isolation): `.claude` settings files and `.claude/{skills,agents,commands,hooks}`, `.mcp.json`; in the working directory `.bashrc`/`.zshrc`, `.gitconfig`, `.git/hooks` and `.git/config`; files that would turn the directory into a bare repo; most of `~/.claude`.
- **Network:** all traffic goes through a proxy outside the sandbox; no domains pre-allowed; `allowedDomains`, `strictAllowlist`, managed `allowManagedDomainsOnly`. The proxy decides by client-supplied hostname without inspecting TLS by default (docs warn of domain-fronting exfiltration).
- **Escape hatches:** a failed command may be retried unsandboxed through the normal permission flow (`dangerouslyDisableSandbox`); disable with `allowUnsandboxedCommands: false`. `excludedCommands` runs listed commands outside the sandbox and "has no equivalent managed-only lockdown". If the sandbox cannot start, Claude Code by default **warns and runs unsandboxed**; `sandbox.failIfUnavailable: true` makes that a hard failure.
- **Docs' own caveat:** "Sandboxing reduces risk but is not a complete isolation boundary."
- **Reference host:** sandbox status not checked for this pack (unverified). Agents run as root (§11), so OS-level isolation that relies on the user's own permissions does not apply to files root can write outside the sandbox (inference).

### §10.4 Claude Code — PreToolUse hook limits (verified, §2.1)

- Sees `tool_name`, `tool_input` (for Bash the command *text* only) and context fields; it does not see what a script will do, environment of the tool shell, or files the command will read.
- **Coverage by tool:** a hook gates only the tools its matcher names. In this repository Read, Grep, Glob, WebFetch, NotebookEdit and all but one MCP tool are ungated (§2.2). An MCP server that can write files or execute commands is a route around Bash/Write/Edit gates unless matched (inference).
- Fails open on crash, failure to start, or timeout (§2.1).
- Hooks are configured in settings files the agent's OS user can edit when it owns them; the docs say file-watcher edits are normally picked up live. `allowManagedHooksOnly` in managed settings restricts hooks to managed ones.

### §10.5 codex (OpenAI Codex CLI) — partially verified

Source: https://learn.chatgpt.com/docs/agent-approvals-security (redirect target of the Codex sandbox docs, fetched 2026-10-01). Installed on the reference host: codex-cli 0.153.4 (measured).
- **Sandbox modes:** `read-only`; `workspace-write` (default: edits and commands inside the workspace); `danger-full-access` ("No sandbox; no approvals").
- **OS mechanisms:** macOS Seatbelt (`sandbox-exec`); Linux `bwrap` + `seccomp`; Windows native sandbox or WSL2.
- **Protected in `workspace-write`:** `.git` (including gitdir pointers) and `.codex` stay read-only.
- **Network:** off by default.
- **Approval policies:** `on-request`, `never`, `granular`.
- **Managed config:** admins set `requirements.toml` to constrain allowed policies and network rules (details unverified).
- **Hooks equivalent to PreToolUse:** unverified.

### §10.6 opencode — partially verified

Source: https://opencode.ai/docs/permissions/ (fetched 2026-10-01). Installed on the reference host: opencode 1.18.31 (measured).
- **Permissions:** `allow` / `ask` / `deny` per tool; bash patterns with `*` and `?` wildcards matched against the parsed command; "last matching rule wins"; per-agent overrides.
- **Defaults:** most permissions default to `allow`; `external_directory` and `doom_loop` default to `ask`; `.env` reads blocked.
- **Sandbox:** none documented on that page (unverified whether one exists).
- **Managed/system config precedence:** not documented on that page (unverified).
- **Plugin hooks that can block tool calls** (e.g. `tool.execute.before`): unverified.

---

## §11 Reference host facts (measured 2026-10-01 unless marked)

- **Agents run as root today:** `id -u` = 0 in the agent's Bash tool. `sudo -n true` succeeds (passwordless sudo exists).
- **Enforcement files the agent's user can write** (all owned by root; the agent is root, so every one is writable):

| Path | Owner / mode | What it controls |
|---|---|---|
| `.claude/settings.json` | root:root 600 | hook registration (§2.2) |
| `.claude/settings.local.json` | root (present) | local overrides |
| `agents/context/*.sh` (hook bodies) | root:root 775 | every gate |
| `bin/fw` | root:root 775 | dispatcher for every hook |
| `lib/` (incl. `lib/tier0_action.py`) | root:root 775 | approval logic and store |
| `.context/working/` | root:root 775, plus a POSIX ACL granting rwx to one additional non-root local user | approval store `tier0-action-approvals.json` (created on first approval; absent at measurement time), legacy `.tier0-approval.pending` / `.lock`, focus, budget status |
| `.git/hooks/pre-push` | root:root 775 | T-3594 pre-push guard (installed: 5 references to the guard) |
| `.context/secrets/review-dispatch.key` | not inspected (secrets) | HMAC key for the verdict ledger (CLAUDE.md, T-3581) |

- **Claude Code's own protections** (§10.1, §10.3) apply to `.claude/` and `.git/` writes made through its tools in prompting modes, and inside the sandbox. They do not apply to writes made by a process the agent starts outside the sandbox (inference from the docs; not tested).
- **Managed settings:** none deployed (`/etc/claude-code/` absent). No codex `/etc/codex/` either.
- **Remotes:** two remotes, `origin` (a self-hosted OneDev server) and `github` (public mirror).
- **OneDev server-side branch/tag protection:** **unknown** (not determinable read-only from the agent's side for this pack). CLAUDE.md calls it "the stronger control and … the operator's decision".
- **Watchtower** runs locally on a per-project port and exposes `POST /api/approvals/decide`, which writes the approval record (T0-071). Its docstring calls it "the unfakeable surface"; its CSRF token is readable by a GET from the same host (R7 Claude; not re-tested).

---

## §12 Elevation (D5) background

### §12.1 How elevation works today

- **Tier 0 approvals.** When `check-tier0` blocks, it lists the action(s) (`force-push {remote, ref}`, `branch-delete {remote, ref}` or local `git branch -D`, `hard-reset {repo, branch, target commit}`, `recursive-delete {path}`) or, if unmapped, the exact command text. The operator approves with `cd /opt/999-Agentic-Engineering-Framework && bin/fw tier0 approve` or the Watchtower `/approvals` page. Each approval covers **one** use within a grant TTL; push approvals are *admitted* at the text gate and must be *consumed* by pre-push within 60 s. Approvals are records in `.context/working/tier0-action-approvals.json` (flock-locked) plus the legacy exact-text files.
- **Who may approve.** Any command containing the gate's keyword is treated as Tier 0 except a plainly spelled read-only status/list/help form; the approving module refuses `approve-pending` under `CLAUDECODE=1` unless `--i-am-human` is passed (recorded as `approved_by: agent-override`). Stated residual: an agent running as the same user can write an approval record directly (T0-016) — the check is "fail-closed against accidents and unsophisticated self-approval, not forgery-resistant".
- **Tier 2.** Single-use, logged human authorisations: `--skip-*` flags on task close (each needs `--reason`; criterion/ownership skips refused under `CLAUDECODE=1` without `--i-am-human`), `FW_ALLOW_*` env overrides for specific hooks, logged to `.context/working/.gate-bypass-log.yaml`.
- **Paid review backends.** `fw review propose` → operator `fw review approve RP-XXXX` (refused under `CLAUDECODE=1` without `--i-am-human`) → one use.
- **OS privilege.** Agents run as root, so no OS-level elevation is needed today; `sudo -n` also works without a password (§11). After the D5 ruling, none of this survives as-is.
- **Notification channel.** The framework already sends push notifications through an ntfy server (`fw notify`), and Watchtower exposes approval buttons; a one-tap approval UX would build on one of these (inference; the authenticity of a tap is not established today — see T0-071).

### §12.2 Operator requirements (question v2, D5; operator ruling 2026-10-01)

Agents WILL run as non-root users, with "a good and frictionless way to allow elevated execution". The elevation path must provide:
- least privilege;
- every elevation attributable and auditable;
- fail closed;
- the agent can never approve its own elevation;
- **pre-approved, low-risk categories run with NO prompt;**
- **risky ones need at most ONE operator action** (e.g. a one-tap approval from Watchtower or a push notification);
- works on Linux, macOS and Windows via WSL, for vendored consumers.

Mechanisms the question asks reviewers to compare: scoped sudoers rules; a privileged broker (a separate service that checks policy and operator-signed approvals, then executes); polkit or an equivalent; time-boxed elevation leases; harness-native permission prompts (§10). Which categories count as "low-risk" is not yet defined: PROPOSED, NOT CONFIRMED.

### §12.3 Examples of operations that legitimately need elevation (from this project's work; inference)

Installing a package (bubblewrap/socat for the sandbox, Python deps for Watchtower); restarting a service (Watchtower, cron jobs); writing protected config (`.claude/settings.json`, git hooks, managed settings, cron registry install); an operator-approved force push or ref deletion; recovering a consumer install (`fw consumer-recover`).

## §13 Prior decisions and their state

Added for question v3. Each subsection summarises named documents; status lines were checked on this host on 2026-10-01 (commands named inline).

### §13.1 T-2428 — governance by payload mediation (inception GO 2026-06-18; arc-013 `payload-mediation`, status in-progress)

**Sources:** `docs/reports/T-2428-payload-mediation-design.md` (design of record, `design_status: final`), `docs/reports/T-2428-payload-mediation-spike.md`, `.context/arcs/payload-mediation.yaml`, member tasks T-2429…T-2434.

**Thesis (design §1).** Govern agents by mediating their tool-call payloads at the model-API request/response layer: a model-agnostic gateway that can allow, deny, rewrite or route each tool intent, made unbypassable by an OS-level cage laid above the agent. Governance attaches to the protocol (the `tool_use`/`tool_result` contract), not to a harness, model or wrapper.

**Headline mechanic (arc YAML, verbatim):** "Operator prompts an agent to attempt a self-authorizing action (edit a governance hook, self-approve a dispatch); the out-of-cage payload proxy denies the tool call at the wire and the OS sandbox blocks the write; operator observes on Watchtower that the action never executed and the agent could not bypass it". `demo_evidence: null`.

**Capture surfaces (design §2, §4a).** Two nested contracts:
- **Outer** (model ⟷ harness): structured `tool_use` blocks over the Messages/tool-calling API. A proxy here sees **every** tool intent (Bash, MCP, in-process built-ins such as Read/Write) as structured name + arguments, before execution.
- **Inner** (harness ⟷ kernel): argv/env/stdio/exit. An OS layer sees only what forks/execs or does I/O, as raw bytes, without intent; it is blind to in-process built-ins.

What the proxy cannot see (design §4a table): execution of Bash, file I/O, MCP calls, hooks, wrapper/loop, telemetry, auth refresh, and above all the harness's internal control flow (does it honour hook exit codes, execute only response-carried `tool_use`, report results truthfully). That row is a black box to both surfaces. Consequence stated in the design: AEF hooks are "proxy-class governance" that fire only because the harness chooses to run them; they cannot be the boundary for "the agent can't self-authorize".

**Ranked surfaces (design §4b).** S1 in-harness hooks/permissions (declinable, harness-specific: "never a boundary"); S2 payload proxy via `ANTHROPIC_BASE_URL` (complete, semantic, portable, bypassable unless pinned); S3 netns + nftables egress allowlist (the pin); S4 filesystem RO (Landlock / mount-ns / RO binds: the "Lock-1 cage"); S5 uid demotion + cgroup/pid-ns; S6 LD_PRELOAD/FUSE (rejected as a boundary).

**"Proxy plus OS cage" composition (design §4, §4b correction, §4c).**
- Proxy alone: complete and semantic but bypassable (the harness can reach the model endpoint directly). Cage alone: unbypassable but blind to intent and to in-process tools.
- Corrected framing (2026-06-18, operator): two **co-essential** surfaces split by what they govern. Proxy = **choices/mechanism** (which tool, which mechanism; e.g. forcing `fw task create` over a built-in TaskCreate, TermLink workers over in-process sub-agents). Sandbox = **effects** (real writes, egress, spawns). Neither subsumes the other.
- Residual: in-process sub-agents lose attribution, so sub-agents must be forced out into distinct observable principals.
- Trust model: proxy = policy engine for a cooperating harness; OS cage = containment for a non-cooperating one, and "the only trust anchor".
- Control plane: **emit/install** split. `fw policy emit` / `fw sandbox emit-profile` are agent-runnable; `sudo fw policy install` / `sudo fw sandbox install` are human/root only ("Lock-1 Part 1"). One governance model compiles to both surfaces (e.g. "agent may not modify hooks" = proxy denies Write to a hook path + sandbox mounts hook paths RO).
- Trusted dynamic state (focus, approvals, budget, bypass log) must move behind a privileged setter the agent uid cannot write (§4e: `aef-govd`, uid `aef-gov`, unix-socket proposals, append-only audit, a sovereign-authored **authority envelope** with a global risk ceiling plus per-type overrides; Tier 0 and directive authorship are a non-delegable floor). Files become read-only projections of the holder's record.
- Sandbox tier (§7a, operator-confirmed): **microVM target** (kata + Cloud-Hypervisor/Firecracker, custom virtio-fs/virtio-net backends as the effects decider), **gVisor fallback**; Landlock + nftables as a static floor inside either. Linux-only is accepted because "portability lives at the proxy".

**Spike results (T-2429, spike report).** All three PASS on 2026-06-18: (1) a Claude Code **subscription** session pointed at a transparent relay via `ANTHROPIC_BASE_URL` stayed on subscription billing (OAuth Bearer forwarded unchanged; refresh goes to a different host and is not intercepted); (2) the relay sees exact tool name + arguments for Bash, MCP and built-ins; (3) a denied `tool_use` can be replaced by a coherent text-only turn (`stop_reason: end_turn`, no owed `tool_result`) and the harness recovers. Caveats: the relay sees the cleartext Bearer, so it must run outside the cage under a non-agent uid; the model makes two `/v1/messages` calls per one-line prompt.

**What is BUILT (code in repo, unit-tested; verified by `wc -l` and the task files):**

| Piece | Task | Code | State |
|---|---|---|---|
| Relay (proxy brain) | T-2431 (completed) | `lib/govd_relay.py`, 245 lines: `parse_tool_uses`, `synth_deny_turn`, `Policy`, `Mediator`, `serve()` | 14 unit tests; allow + deny live-validated on the subscription path. **Buffers the whole upstream body** before mediating (no incremental streaming). Policy = governance-path list + **substring** `deny_command_patterns` (`rm -rf /`, `git push --no-verify`, `chattr -a`, `shutdown`, `mkfs`) from `policy/proxy-policy.yaml` (31 lines). |
| Policy emit/install + drift | T-2432 (completed) | `lib/govd_policy.py`, 130 lines | `fw policy status` today: `SKIP proxy-policy not installed`. |
| State holder / authority broker | T-2430 (work-completed, still in `active/`) | `lib/govd_envelope.py` 119, `lib/govd_holder.py` 194 lines | Mechanism built and tested. Two Human ACs open: deploy as root under a non-agent service user; relocate real `focus.yaml`/approvals/bypass log behind it. |
| Sandbox static floor | T-2433 (work-completed, in `active/`) | `lib/govd_sandbox.py`, 382 lines; `policy/sandbox-profile.yaml`; emitted systemd unit + uid-keyed nftables ruleset | `fw sandbox status` today: `SKIP sandbox profile emitted but not installed`. Open Human ACs: install the floor and run the deciding validation; decide who installs a VMM. |

**Not built / not deployed (checked 2026-10-01):** no `aef-agent` or `aef-gov` user exists (`id` fails); nothing under `/etc/aef-sandbox` or `/etc/systemd/system/aef-*`; relay not running in front of any session; no VMM or gVisor installed; the microVM tier half (virtio-fs/virtio-net mediators) has no code; T-2434 (Lock-1 acceptance demo) is `captured`, `horizon: later`, with template placeholder ACs; the arc's headline mechanic has never fired. T-2428 itself is `work-completed` with its `[REVIEW]` Human AC unticked.

**Open questions (from the documents, plus what the build left):**
1. Who performs Lock-1 Part 1 (root install of holder, policy, sandbox) and when; nothing has been installed in 3.5 months.
2. Sandbox tier: microVM vs gVisor tooling and who installs it (T-2433 H2). The design's own deciding validation (does CC + TermLink + wrapper run inside the tier with substrate RO and egress pinned) has not been run.
3. The relay's policy is substring matching on command text, the same class of check whose spelling gaps the Tier 0 rounds catalogue (§5, §6); the design defers "rich decisions" to a framework oracle (`fw policy decide`) that does not exist.
4. Incremental streaming denial: the spike proved a buffered substitution; mid-stream rewriting without buffering remains unproven (design §5 named it the key build risk).
5. Non-Anthropic wire formats (OpenAI `tool_calls`, opencode/Z.ai, codex) are asserted "isomorphic" (design §3); only the Anthropic path was tested (unverified for the others).
6. Wiring the proxy's dynamic-state trust to the holder (the relay reads only static policy today).
7. Distinct principals for sub-agents: named as a requirement, no task.

### §13.2 T-586 — language strategy: TypeScript for new components (inception GO 2026-03-23; closed 2026-04-13)

**Sources:** `.tasks/completed/T-586-language-strategy--typescript-adoption-f.md`, `docs/reports/T-586-{language-audit,q1-compilation,q2-vendoring,q3-inspectability,q4-shell-escaping,q5-language-count,prototype-comparison,migration-path,constitutional-review}.md`.

**Why TypeScript (audit, March 2026 figures):** the framework was a three-language hybrid (42K bash, 25K Python, 13K Jinja, 13K JS); 54 of 98 bash scripts shelled out to Python; 199 inline `python3 -c` blocks, 84 (≈56% judged unsafe) interpolating shell variables into Python source, 32 invocations breaking on quotes. Node.js was taken as "guaranteed" on target hosts because Claude Code requires it. esbuild compiles in ~3 ms; compiled JS started ~2.5× faster than Python. Language count argued to stay at two (bash + TS), with TS **replacing** Python over time; Watchtower stays Python.

**Scorecard (prototype comparison):** a PostToolUse loop detector built twice — TS 261 LOC vs bash+Python 218 LOC. TS 28 ms vs 54 ms; TS immune to the `'''` escaping break; compile-time type checks; importable/unit-testable functions. **TS 8, bash+Python 2, tie 1.** Constitutional review: D1 and D2 net positive, D3 net positive with build-step friction, D4 neutral.

**Migration path (migration-path report):** bash stays forever for `bin/fw`, git hooks, `install.sh`, init/update/setup, and short glue. Tier 1: new components in TS (loop detector T-578, dedup T-579, error classification T-580, session isolation T-582, health T-583, structured logging T-584, token budget T-585). Tier 2: migrate inline Python when touched via an `fw-util` binary (~130 YAML, ~74 JSON, ~87 path, ~43 date blocks). Tier 3 never: Watchtower, `enrich.py`, `discovery.py`. Sources in `lib/ts/src/`, compiled `lib/ts/dist/` committed; vendoring ships only compiled JS; `fw_run_ts()` falls back to Python when Node is absent.

**What exists today in `lib/ts/` (`wc -l`, 2026-10-01; last commits T-592/T-593/T-594):**

| File | Lines |
|---|---|
| `src/fw-util.ts` (8 subcommands: yaml-get/set, json-get/set, path-rel, path-resolve, date-fmt, frontmatter) | 228 |
| `src/loop-detect.ts` | 269 |
| `dist/fw-util.js` (bundled, includes js-yaml) | 2,817 |
| `dist/loop-detect.js` | 178 |
| `package.json` / `tsconfig.json` / `package-lock.json` | 17 / 16 / 561 |

Plus `lib/build.sh`, `lib/runtime.sh` (`fw_run_ts`). **In use:** `loop-detect.js` runs as a PostToolUse hook via `fw hook loop-detect` → `agents/context/loop-detect.sh` (`.claude/settings.json:194`). `fw-util` is referenced only by `lib/runtime.sh` (definition), `lib/validate-init.sh` and `agents/audit/self-audit.sh`.

**What was never done:** none of T-579…T-585 shipped in TS; no inline Python was migrated to `fw-util` — the `python3 -c` count in `bin lib agents` `*.sh` is now **234** (grep, 2026-10-01; up from 199), and `bin/fw` alone is 10,901 lines of bash; no gate, hook other than loop-detect, or Tier 0 code is TypeScript; the CI `tsc --noEmit` / pre-push type-check legs were not found (unverified). The T-586 Human ACs asked whether TS "truly serves directives or engineering convenience"; the task closed without a later re-assessment.

### §13.3 P-063 — opencode runs zero AEF hooks (framework:pickup, 2026-09-07, bug-report, priority high)

Filed by an opencode agent in `/opt/0506-Voxtype-extention`: AEF enforces through `.claude/settings.json` PreToolUse wiring, which opencode never loads, so **none of the 37 fw hooks run in opencode sessions**. Concrete harm (2026-09-06): an opencode session crossed into another project's directory, read its files and planned work there with `check-project-boundary` never firing; the same command in Claude Code exits 2. The reporter verified that the hook *protocol* is runtime-agnostic (stdin JSON with `tool_name` + `tool_input`, exit 0 allow, exit 2 block, stderr guidance) and shipped a local opencode plugin (`.opencode/plugin/aef-guards.ts`, driving check-project-boundary, check-active-task and check-tier0; fail-open when `fw` is absent; Bash rewritten to a refusal no-op, edit/write cancelled by throwing) plus an installer. The ask: ship a `runtime/opencode/` plugin pack beside the `.claude` wiring, with the hook list in one manifest both runtimes read. **State in this repo (2026-10-01):** no `runtime/` or `.opencode/` directory; no task references P-063 or `aef-guards` (grep of `.tasks/`).

## §14 The harness landscape

Source: `docs/harnesses.md` (T-3582, verified on this host 2026-10-01 unless marked), plus §13.3. "Honours AEF hooks" means the `.claude/settings.json` PreToolUse/PostToolUse chain of §2 runs before tool execution.

| Harness | Version (this host) | How AEF uses it today | Instruction file read | Own native controls | Honours AEF hooks? |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| Claude Code | 2.1.286 (`claude`) | Primary interactive session (`claude-fw`), TermLink workers, review panel seat 1 | `CLAUDE.md` | permission rules, managed settings, Bash sandbox, hooks (§10) | **Yes**, interactive in-repo sessions. **No** for pinned review workers (`--setting-sources user`: no project hooks, verified). Fires only because the harness runs them (§13.1 §4a). |
| Codex CLI (OpenAI) | codex-cli 0.153.4 | Review panel seat 2 (`codex exec -s read-only`), review-only worker kind | `AGENTS.md` (disabled with `project_doc_max_bytes=0`) | own config + execpolicy rules, `-s` sandbox modes | **No** (none) |
| opencode (Z.ai) | 1.18.31 | Review panel seat 3 (`opencode run`), review-only worker kind; also used interactively in other projects (P-063) | `AGENTS.md` (no off switch); `CLAUDE.md` only if no `AGENTS.md` | `opencode.json`, built-in `plan` no-edit agent, plugins | **No** — zero of 37 (P-063); a local plugin bridge exists outside this repo |
| Antigravity (`agy`, Google) | 1.1.15, runs as user `dimitri-mint-dev` | Spare review seat | unverified | `--mode plan --sandbox` | **No** (none) |
| Gemini CLI | not installed | — | — | — | — |

Non-Claude harnesses are dispatched only with `--task-type review` (harnesses.md "Harness kinds"); their governance today is the review-ledger signing and read-only/plan modes, not AEF gates.
