# T-3670: Review question v2 (after the 3-model question review)

Changes from v1 are driven by docs/reports/T-3670-qreview-{claude-code,codex,opencode}.md:
- **Split into four separate decisions,** with the enforcement architecture first (all three).
- **"Closed" defined against an explicit threat model** (all three).
- **Lean leakage removed:** libraries named for every option or none; hypotheses stated as hypotheses (all three).
- **Lean WITHHELD in round 1** (Claude, Codex; Z.ai preferred disclosing it as data). An optional round 2 shows the lean and the other verdicts.
- **A machine-readable verdict block first,** weighted criteria with anchors, security as a pass/fail GATE rather than a weighted score (Codex), the table excluded from the word count (all three).
- **One frozen context pack for all seven;** internal reviewers report repo-only findings separately (Codex).
- **An explicit priority order when criteria conflict** (Z.ai).

Items marked **[OPERATOR]** need the operator's confirmation before dispatch.

## The question (v3: reframed after the operator's direction, 2026-10-01)

**The operator's aim from the start: a governance layer that does NOT depend on the agent harness.** PreToolUse hooks are a Claude Code mechanism. Other harnesses run none of them: opencode runs zero AEF hooks (pack §13, P-063). Two prior decisions bear directly on this and must be weighed, not ignored (pack §13):
- **T-2428, payload mediation (GO 2026-06-18, arc in progress).** Govern at the model⟷harness contract (the structured tool_use/tool_result messages) through a payload proxy OUTSIDE the agent's cage, plus an OS funnel/cage (egress pinning, process isolation) for what the proxy cannot see. It is harness- and model-agnostic by construction. Its headline: the agent attempts self-authorisation, the out-of-cage proxy denies it at the wire, and the OS sandbox blocks the write.
- **T-586, language strategy (GO 2026-03-23):** TypeScript adopted for new framework components (Node is available wherever the harness runs; immune to shell-escape defects; a `fw-util` replacing inline Python). It is partly implemented (lib/ts/).

The operator also intends to refactor and rewrite pieces in different languages, stepping away from the bash/Python-only base. A polyglot answer (a different language per component) is acceptable if justified.

So D1 below is primarily: **which enforcement architecture gives harness-independent governance** (payload proxy, OS cage and isolation, a broker for elevation, per-harness adapters such as hooks), and where the existing hook-based core fits in it. Add TypeScript to every language comparison. If you disagree with T-2428 or T-586, say so with reasons.

AEF governs AI coding agents. Hooks run on every agent tool call and must fail closed (pack §2). The enforcement core comprises:
- the Tier 0 destructive-action gate;
- the task and focus gates;
- the context-budget gate;
- the reviewer-verdict ledger;
- the task-close gates.
It is written mostly in bash, with some Python (pack §1).

**Threat model (pack §3), confirmed by the operator 2026-10-01: BOTH, as strong as possible.** The enforcement must:
- (a) reliably catch a cooperative agent's MISTAKES;
- (b) hold against a DETERMINED adversarial agent that is actively searching for gaps (obscure spellings, wrapping in scripts, editing the approval store, editing the hooks themselves).

Today every agent runs as the same OS user as the enforcement: root on the reference host. So (b) is currently unachievable by any hook implementation alone. That residual was accepted in T-3581 as a STARTING point, not as the goal. Reviewers must therefore design a LAYERED enforcement:
1. a guardrail layer (the hooks) that is as complete as possible for (a);
2. an isolation layer the agent cannot reach, for (b). Candidates:
   - running the agent as a non-root user without write access to hooks, settings, the approval store or .git/hooks;
   - harness managed/policy settings the agent cannot override;
   - harness-native permission rules and sandboxing;
   - approvals signed by a component outside the agent's reach;
   - server-side branch and tag protection.
For each layer, state what it guarantees and against whom. Name explicitly the gaps that ONLY the agent harness vendor could close. The operator wants that list as an evidenced feature request.

Priority when there is doubt: a missed destructive action (a false allow) is worse than a false block.

**Problem A (pack §5).** The Tier 0 gate classifies shell command TEXT as destructive or not. In each of seven review rounds, reviewers found a new spelling that bypassed it or reused an approval: brace expansion, line continuation, ANSI-C quoting, quote removal, target normalisation. Each cited case has an ID, the command and the expected outcome.

**Problem B (pack §6).** The core has a record of silent defects. Each is tagged by likely cause: language, parsing, or spec/design.

These observations do not by themselves establish causes or justify a rewrite.

**Decide four things, in this order:**
- **D1, the enforcement architecture for destructive actions.** Options include, and are not limited to:
  - patching the current matcher;
  - parsing a real syntax tree;
  - a default-deny allowlist of exact shapes;
  - harness-native permission rules or sandboxing;
  - interposing on execution instead of classifying text;
  - a hybrid.
  Define "closed": which bypass classes become impossible under the §3 threat model, and which remain?
- **D2, the implementation language for the core,** given D1: bash (status quo), strict Python, Go, Rust, or other. "No change" is a first-class answer.
- **D3, scope:** which pack-§1 modules are "core". Use or replace this criterion: security-critical, stable specification, a substantial test suite, runs on every call.
- **D4, delivery:** how the core ships to vendored consumers on Linux, macOS and Windows via WSL (pack §7), and what happens when a component is missing or fails. Falling back to a known-vulnerable path is NOT fail-closed.

- **D5, the elevation path.** Operator decision 2026-10-01: agents WILL run as non-root users. The design needs "a good and frictionless way to allow elevated execution". How does a non-root agent perform an operation that legitimately needs more privilege (installing a package, restarting a service, writing protected config, a force-push the operator approved) without re-opening the bypass? Requirements:
  - least privilege;
  - every elevation is attributable and auditable;
  - it fails closed;
  - the agent can never approve its own elevation;
  - pre-approved, low-risk categories run with NO prompt;
  - risky ones need at most ONE operator action (for example a one-tap approval from Watchtower or a push notification);
  - it works on Linux, macOS and Windows via WSL, for vendored consumers.
  Compare at least: scoped sudoers rules; a privileged broker (a separate service that checks policy and operator-signed approvals, then executes); polkit or an equivalent; time-boxed elevation leases; harness-native permission prompts. Say which tier of the current Tier 0 / approval model maps to which mechanism.

If any decision is mis-framed, say so first, then answer the question you think we should have asked, in this same structure. "Insufficient evidence" is allowed if you name the experiment that would settle it.

**Priorities when criteria conflict:**
1. No unreviewed destructive action executes.
2. Fail closed, always.
3. Hook latency within budget (pack §4).
4. Maintainable by the team in pack §8.
5. Migration cost.

## Response structure (≤1,500 words, excluding the table)

0. **VERDICT block** (exact format, first):
   ```
   D1: <architecture> | survives-pilot confidence: <low|medium|high> because <evidence>
   D2: <bash | python-strict | go | rust | other:X | no-change>
   D3: <module list>
   D4: <mechanism>
   D5: <elevation mechanism> | prompt-free categories: <list> | one-tap categories: <list>
   PILOT: <one module> | STOP IF: <measurable condition>
   WOULD CHANGE MY MIND: <one piece of evidence>
   ```
1. **Diagnosis (≤200 words).** Roughly what share of the pack §5 and §6 defects are parsing, language, or spec/design? Cite the case IDs.
2. **Security contract per layer (≤250 words).** For the guardrail layer and the isolation layer separately: what is trusted, what is guaranteed against the mistaken agent (a) and against the determined adversary (b), what is excluded, and how unsupported input is handled. End with a bullet list: **"gaps only the harness vendor can close"**.
3. **Options table.**
   - **Rows, architecture options:** hooks only, hardened; payload proxy plus OS cage (T-2428); harness-native permissions and sandbox; a hybrid; one of your own.
   - **Rows, implementation options** (for the components your architecture needs): bash plus a parser; strict Python plus bashlex; TypeScript (T-586); Go plus mvdan.cc/sh; Rust plus tree-sitter-bash; polyglot per component.
   - **Gate column first, PASS/FAIL/UNKNOWN:** does it close the Tier 0 bypass class within §3?
   - **Scored columns, 1–5:** closes the §6 defects ×2; portability and distribution ×2; migration risk ×2; maintainability ×2; latency ×1.
   - **Score anchors:** 1 = worse or no effect, 3 = meets target, 5 = materially exceeds target; "?" = unknown, unscored.
   - **Justifications:** at most 12 words per cell.
4. **D1–D4 reasoning** (≤120 words each).
5. **Migration and validation (≤250 words):**
   - the sequence;
   - side-by-side parity runs;
   - the test suites as the behavioural contract, and what they do NOT cover;
   - fail-closed handling;
   - rollback triggers.
6. **Strongest case against your own verdict (≤150 words).**
7. **Assumptions and missing facts** (bullets, ranked by how likely each is to change your verdict; cite § or write "none").

Rules:
- Cite pack § and case IDs for every fact.
- No production code; snippets of 15 lines or fewer are fine.
- Do not invent benchmarks.
- Do not treat the existing tests as a complete security specification.

## Context pack additions required by v2 (the pack worker started from v1)
- §2 the hook protocol (JSON on stdin, exit codes) and the gate chain per tool call;
- **§3 the threat model** (above) and the cost of a false allow versus a false block;
- §4 the latency budget [OPERATOR] and the measured p50/p95 per hook;
- §5 Tier 0 cases with stable IDs: the command, the expected outcome and the round found, plus benign commands that must stay allowed;
- §6 the defect catalogue tagged language/parsing/spec;
- §7 distribution: vendoring, `fw upgrade`, the P-01 installer, supported OS and bash versions, hard constraints (no toolchain on consumer hosts, offline install, binary size, licence);
- §8 the team: one operator plus AI agents. Who reviews Go or Rust code?
- a neutral description of the parsers (mvdan.cc/sh, bashlex, tree-sitter-bash) and their known limits;
- the harness-native options as they exist TODAY, verified against current Claude Code documentation, not memory:
  - permission rules (allow/deny/ask);
  - managed/policy settings and their precedence;
  - the Bash sandbox (filesystem and network restrictions);
  - the PreToolUse hook contract and its limits.
  Also the same for the other harnesses where known (codex, opencode);
- the reference host facts: agents run as root today; which files the agent can write (hooks, settings, the approval store, .git/hooks); OneDev server-side protection status.

## Process
1. Freeze the pack.
2. Round 1: all seven answer blind (no lean).
3. Synthesise the verdict blocks.
4. Optional round 2: show each reviewer the six other verdicts plus the lean, and ask for the strongest objection.
