# T-3557 — Human review is for risk; everything else goes to an agent reviewer

Research artefact (C-001). Inception opened 2026-09-29 from a walkthrough of
open decisions, when the operator's answer to "item A" (OBS-572) reframed the
delegation model it sat inside.

## Dialogue Log

### Segment 1 — how the question arose

The agent had proposed OBS-572: fix `_ACT_IN_THE_WORLD_RE` so the D-626 delegation
classifier stops treating six criteria as delegable when their steps need the
operator's own hardware or a live session. Examples given, both real:

- **T-1774** — *"End-to-end CLI smoke (after … pi installed)"*; Expected "exit code
  0". The install detector requires `install` + space + word; here it is followed
  by `)`, so it misses, and the classifier calls it mechanical.
- **T-464** — *"Test `/capture` skill in a live session"*. No install or login
  vocabulary at all, so nothing fires.

The agent's stated risk: a delegated reviewer would tick "exit code 0" on a smoke
test that never ran.

### Segment 2 — the operator's answer (verbatim, voice transcript)

> Yes, that's true, because we want to kick out the rubber stamping, it's just a lot
> of friction, so in the end doesn't really have value, and just click, click,
> click, and just pass up. The thinking by this is that we want human in the loop
> for things that have high risk, right? That's all tier 0 or really big UX. But UX
> you can also test yourself, so it's the end, maybe are you fine, but I'll give you
> that feedback anyway. You just tell me it's good and I give you the feedback, so
> it's basically risk. Tier 0, yeah. That is where we need to service to the human,
> right?
>
> What do you mean is the expected result of mechanical check? The expected result
> is a pass, because this and this is the external agent that has revealed it. And
> it says it's good. I've looked at this and this and that's why it's good. Or it
> says it's not good and this is what's needed to bring it to good. Or it says,
> nuclear escalate to human. If it cannot resolve that. No, it's not mechanical. It
> remains very much an evaluation. It's not binary. Mostly it's not binary.
> Sometimes it is, but mostly it's not binary. Interpretation is needed, right?
> That's why we want agent reviewer. And don't put it in a script essay. Agent, you
> do it. And if we can run scripts to assess parts, for instance, are certain fields
> in the database or whatever, is the code corrected? Then that's fine. We can use
> our scripts, but it's not only that. It's not binary. Almost never is.
>
> Test capture scale in the live session. I have no idea what this is about. We had
> a capture because we want to capture conversation with an agent that's not
> locked. So it didn't get lost. But not sure where, how it pops here now.
>
> So. Confused will never get recorded. Yeah, that is the negative recording, right?
> We were talking about that we also want to capture things that don't succeed. And
> act on that.

### What the agent took from it

1. **Course correction — "mechanical" was the wrong frame.** The agent had described
   the reviewer's job as confirming a mechanical Expected clause. The operator
   rejects that: review is *evaluation*, rarely binary. Scripts may inform it; they
   do not constitute it.
2. **The default inverts.** Human for risk (Tier 0, irreversible, sovereign); agent
   reviewer for the rest, including UX — with operator feedback *after* an agent
   green, not a blocking gate before it.
3. **Three outcomes, not two** — good-with-reasons, not-good-with-what's-needed,
   escalate-when-unresolvable. This is `lib/judge_verdict.py` (T-3525): green,
   amber/red with mandatory guidance, unknown.
4. **OBS-572 is superseded, not fixed.** An interpreting reviewer reading T-1774 sees
   it needs a Raspberry Pi it cannot operate and returns *unknown → escalate*. The
   regex patch would have repaired the layer this removes.
5. **"Negative recording" ties to T-3555.** Every non-green verdict and every
   escalation is itself a thing that did not succeed, and belongs on the refusal
   ledger the operator approved minutes earlier.

### On T-464

`/capture` is the skill that saves a conversation to `docs/reports/` so it is not
lost when a session ends (C-001/C-002, origin T-194). T-464 is an old PR task
(PR #6) whose only open criterion is a `[RUBBER-STAMP]` "try `/capture` in a live
session". It surfaced here only because the regex misclassified it. It is exactly
the click-through the operator wants gone — and under this model it would be judged
by the reviewer, not queued for the operator.

## Findings

### F-1 — The verdict contract exists; the judging agent does not

| component | exists? | what it is |
|---|---|---|
| verdict vocabulary | yes | `lib/judge_verdict.py` — green/amber/red/unknown, guidance mandatory on non-green |
| judging doctrine | yes | D-662 — separate parties, can refuse, criteria + goal hierarchy |
| isolated execution | yes | `lib/termlink_worker.py` (`--dispatch`) |
| **an agent that interprets** | **no** | every judge (`fw reviewer`, BVP judge, arc-driver judge) runs static code; `--dispatch` runs the same static code in a worker |

### F-2 — The operator's desk, today

353 open Human criteria across 329 tasks (`fw reviewer surface`, 2026-09-29, after
T-3554):

| class | n |
|---|---|
| render-surface | 197 |
| unclassified | 62 |
| act-in-the-world | 22 |
| sovereignty-field | 22 |
| taste | 21 |
| inception-decision | 18 |
| tier0-or-bypass | **11** |

Under the operator's rule, the floor of what must stay human is the 11 tier-0
criteria, and the ceiling is roughly 11 + 22 + 22 + 18 = 73, depending on IW-1 and
IW-2. So between 280 and 342 of 353 criteria — **79% to 97%** of today's human
review load — would move to the agent reviewer.

### Segment 3 — operator answers IW-1, IW-2, IW-3 and names the impact-risk model (verbatim)

> On point 1, yes, that is correct. Yes, they also go to agents, although upon
> inception, the agent needs to evaluate if that is something a human in the loop
> should evaluate. I think we need to look at complexity, impact, and uncertainty.
> That is a difficult one, but our closures should be agent-driven, just the same as
> task closures, unless it is a Tier 0 again, right? But our closures work done.
>
> Point 3: Yes, the reviewer is not a creator or producer. That is our principle.
> So, we have different levels. It could be a Termlink agent, another agent over
> Termlink, a Termlink dispatch agent, a different model, from the same vendor, or a
> different vendor. It could be an external agent via OpenRouter, for instance, or
> multiple external agents based on the impact and the risk. So, we need to have an
> impact risk model.
>
> And also, the impact of the change drives how much we spend on the review (low
> risk, risk, risk impact). Impact is both the risk materializing and also the
> impact the change should bring to our product. So, if saying it is closed without
> having delivered what you set out is also a risk, that then drives the Termlink
> review—same agent, another agent, or multiple agent review, multiple lenses/same
> agent, or external review, right? Three, five agents, different agents. But
> external review costs money. Still, we want to have an impact risk model.

### What the agent took from segment 3

| IW | answer |
|---|---|
| IW-1 | Confirmed as proposed: Tier 0, irreversible external acts, sovereignty stay human; UX goes to the agent reviewer with feedback afterwards. |
| IW-2 | Arc closure goes to the agent reviewer, like task closure, unless Tier 0. Inceptions go to the agent reviewer too, but it must first judge whether this particular inception needs a human, on **complexity, impact and uncertainty**. |
| IW-3 | "The reviewer is not a creator or producer." Independence is a **ladder**, not one floor. |

**The review ladder, as stated (cheapest to most independent):**

1. same agent, a different lens
2. another agent over TermLink
3. TermLink dispatch agent
4. different model, same vendor
5. different vendor
6. external agent via OpenRouter
7. several external agents (three, five)

**What selects the rung: an impact-risk model (IW-7, new).** Two points the operator
made that the model has to carry:

- **Impact has two sides.** The risk *materialising*, and the value the change is
  *meant* to bring. So "closed without having delivered what you set out" is itself
  a risk: a high-value task that fails silently costs as much as a risky change
  that breaks something.
- **Review costs money at the top rungs.** The model decides how much to spend, so it
  needs a spend ceiling as well as a ranking.

**Consequence for D-662.** D-662 item 5 deferred the multi-model panel. The operator
now designs it in as the top rungs of the ladder, bought when impact warrants it. So
this supersedes item 5 rather than contradicting it: deferred has become conditional.

**Agent's caveat on the model's inputs, recorded rather than dismissed.** Most of
the signals already exist per task: BVP value, blast_radius, tier, effort, and for
inceptions voi_score and IW confidence. The value axis is coarse, though. Five
vectors cover 69% of 494 active tasks (measured 2026-09-29), so a model that leans
on value alone would put most tasks on the same rung. The cost/risk side
(blast_radius 1 vs 9) discriminates. Both sides need a better value signal to earn
equal weight.

### Segment 4 — operator answers IW-4, IW-5, IW-6

> 4 +5 +6

Read as assent to each proposal. For IW-4, that is the one-off sweep of all open
Human criteria (the answer the agent had suggested); the reading was stated back to
the operator in chat as reversible. IW-7 (the impact-risk model) is the one question
left, and it is answered by design work, not by a ruling.

## IW-7: the impact-risk model (proposal, 2026-09-30)

**The operator's frame:** impact has two sides. One is the risk materialising. The other
is the value the change is meant to bring, because closing something as done without
delivering it is itself a risk. The model sets how much review to buy, and external
review costs money.

**Two questions per criterion, answered from data the framework already holds.**

1. **Must a human decide?** This is a hard gate, not a score. It applies to Tier 0,
   irreversible external acts (publish, deploy, pay, credentials, privileged infra),
   sovereignty fields and project direction. When it applies, the reviewer's job is to
   *recognise* it and escalate, with what the human should look at. Nothing on this
   list is bought down by more review.
2. **Otherwise, how independent must the reviewer be?** This is set by
   `impact = max(cost_if_wrong, value_at_stake)`:

| Input | Where it already lives | High when |
|---|---|---|
| reversibility | git-only change vs anything leaving the repo | anything not undone by `git revert` |
| blast radius | `cost_estimate.blast_radius`, `components:` | ≥5 components, or a consumer-install path (`lib/`, `agents/`, `bin/fw`, `web/`, seeds, `fw upgrade`) |
| audience | vendored surface, other projects | reaches consumer projects or peers |
| value at stake | BVP_norm, inception `voi_score`, arc objective | high-BVP work, `voi_score ≥ 0.6`, project objectives |
| uncertainty | inception IW confidence, reviewer's own confidence | confidence ≤1 on a question the change depends on |

| Impact | Rung (from the operator's independence ladder) | Measured today |
|---|---|---|
| low: reversible, internal, blast ≤2 | 1–2: an independent agent of the same vendor, not the producer | 5 render checks (T-3544/3552/3553/3571/3564). The reviewer found 2 real defects the producer missed. |
| medium: consumer-facing code, blast 3–5, or an inception GO | 3–4: a different model, or TermLink dispatch, with one reviewer | — |
| high: project objectives, security, cross-project, `voi ≥ 0.6` | 5–7: a panel of 3 vendors | project objectives (T-3535). All three returned amber, and they split on 3 mappings, which went to the operator. |

**Spend ceiling.** Every external call is logged with its rung and cost. A weekly
ceiling is set as a config key. When the ceiling is reached, work drops one rung *and
says so* in the verdict ("reviewed at rung 2, ceiling reached; rung 5 was due"). It
never silently skips review.

**Why this does not lean on value alone.** The value axis is coarse: 5 vectors cover 69%
of 494 tasks (IW-7 note). So `max()` lets reversibility, blast radius and audience carry
the decision when value does not separate tasks.

**Proposed disposition:** answered, confidence 2. Every input exists already; the
thresholds are first guesses to calibrate against the first month of logged verdicts.
