# T-3564 build notes

Files changed: `web/blueprints/arcs.py` (helpers `_arc_story`, `_task_overview`, `_arc_sections`, `_source_ref`; one ordered `sections` list feeds both the quick-link bar and the section wrappers), `web/templates/arc_detail.html` (quick-link bar under the title; Purpose; Task overview with status counts, the old stats strip, and open-task list; story sections; existing sections wrapped with anchors), `tests/web/test_t3564_arc_page_layout.py` (2 tests).

Order: title → quick links → Purpose → Task overview → success criteria / context / decisions / open questions / non-goals / history / evidence → BVP → reports → constituent table → completion check or arc closed. Story sections and Purpose are omitted entirely when the fields are absent.

Tests: new file 2 passed. Existing arc tests (test_arcs_routes, test_arc_display_helper, test_arcs_membership_cached, test_approvals_blocked_arcs) pass. `tests/unit/test_arcs_pages_tokens.py::test_only_neutral_fallback_hexes_remain` fails on `#2a7`/`#c33` in arc_detail.html; those are T-3429 reviewer badges, and it fails identically with my changes stashed (pre-existing, not touched).

Done: watchtower restart + `current` (ok), `vendor self` + `--check` (clean). Not done: the independent render review AC (left to the parent) and any browser/screenshot check; the page is ~55s/request under the test client so I did not run playwright arc tests.

## Round 2

Applied render-review GUIDANCE 1-6 (`docs/reports/T-3564-render-review.md`):

1. `_task_overview`: work-completed tasks still in `active/` are labelled `awaiting review` (badge-warn) and listed apart from open tasks; open tasks sort issues, started-work, captured.
2. Both lists capped at 10 with a "+N more — full table" line.
3. Quick-link bar is sticky, with a "Jump to:" label and contrasting background; `scroll-margin-top` raised to 4.5rem (also for `h3[id]`).
4. `_source_ref` links `.tasks/(active|completed)/T-NNNN-…` to `/tasks/T-NNNN`.
5. Scoped-drivers `<h3 id="scoped-drivers">`, added to `_arc_sections` (the one ordered list) when scoped drivers exist.
6. Purpose is a `<blockquote><strong>` headline; objective is plain text below.

Tests: 4 new in `tests/web/test_t3564_arc_page_layout.py`. Run together with test_arcs_routes, test_arc_display_helper, test_arcs_membership_cached and test_approvals_blocked_arcs: 37 passed, 0 failed. Watchtower restarted, `watchtower current` exit 0, `vendor self --check` clean.
