# T-3466 — Dispatch fix: F-15 (read-only allowlist gaps) and F-17 (git-commit task-file dirt)

Worker report for a dispatched, one-turn fix against two findings reported by a
consuming project (vendored at framework 1.6.768, `version_sha:
a6bea48819460a0f250f8983a48fca267e422483`). Both findings were re-derived
against this repo's current source before any edit, per the dispatch contract's
"gatherer/judge were not separated" confidence penalty.

Branch: `t-dispatch-f15-f17-safe-commands-fix`. **Not pushed.**

## F-15 — read-only allowlist refuses two everyday read-only shapes

**Reproduced: partially — one shape confirmed and fixed, one shape confirmed
and deliberately left unfixed (see below).**

### Shape 1: `VAR=$(readonly-cmd)` — reproduced, fixed

Confirmed pre-fix at `agents/context/lib/safe-commands.sh` (the file's own
T-2834 header comment, lines 51-57, states command substitution is
"Deliberately NOT handled" and files the gap as OBS-185):

```
$ source agents/context/lib/safe-commands.sh
$ is_bash_safe_command 'X=$(git status)'; echo $?
1          # pre-fix: refused, although `git status` alone is allowlisted
```

**Fix:** added a narrow recognizer in `_fw_single_command_is_safe`
(`agents/context/lib/safe-commands.sh:266-298`, inserted right after the
existing T-2834 whitespace trim) that matches ONLY a terminal, whole-segment
assignment — `^[A-Za-z_][A-Za-z0-9_]*=\$\(.*\)[[:space:]]*$` — and delegates
the captured inner command back through the top-level chain-aware entry point
`is_bash_safe_command` (not a second call into the single-command function),
so a substitution containing `&&`-joined clauses requires every clause to be
independently safe. This is deliberately narrower than the general "$(...)
anywhere on the line" case the T-2834 comment excludes: a *terminal* assignment
has no outer command for an inner one's safety verdict to bleed into, which is
exactly the risk that comment's exclusion was protecting against for the
general case (e.g. `curl "$(fw watchtower url)/page"`).

### Shape 2: `python3 -m pytest` — reproduced, deliberately NOT fixed

Confirmed pre-fix and post-fix (unchanged):

```
$ is_bash_safe_command 'python3 -m pytest tests/foo.py -q'; echo $?
1
```

**Not fixed, and this is the most valuable finding in this report.** The same
file already states, for the adjacent filter category a few lines below the
`python3|python` arm, that `bats`, `make`, `python3 <file>` and `./script.sh`
are **deliberately excluded** because "a file's contents are not visible to a
command-string scan, so executing one is never provably read-only"
(`safe-commands.sh:568-570`, citing CLAUDE.md §Enforcement Tiers, T-2742, the
Tier 0 scope boundary). `python3 -m pytest <path>` imports and executes every
test module (and `conftest.py`) under `<path>` — the identical class of
"execute unseen file content" the codebase already refuses for its siblings.
Implementing the dispatch's suggested widening as specified would have
silently reopened a hole this same function closes on purpose two case arms
away. There is no narrower safe form either — `--collect-only` still imports
and executes module-level code during collection.

This directly **contradicts** the dispatch's framing of shape 2 as a simple
allowlist gap parallel to shape 1. It is not: shape 1 is an unmeasured gap in
an otherwise-sound category (command substitution wrapping an already-safe
read); shape 2 is a measured, intentional exclusion the dispatch is asking to
override. Declined; documented in the task's Decisions section with full
rationale.

### Checks (negative controls included, per the dispatch's F-15 requirement)

```
$ bash -c 'source agents/context/lib/safe-commands.sh; is_bash_safe_command "X=\$(git status)"; echo rc=$?'
rc=0                                                          # PASS — was rc=1
$ bash -c 'source agents/context/lib/safe-commands.sh; is_bash_safe_command "X=\$(rm -rf /tmp/x)"; echo rc=$?'
rc=1                                                          # PASS — negative control: substitution wrapping a genuine write still gates
$ bash -c 'source agents/context/lib/safe-commands.sh; is_bash_safe_command "python3 -m pytest tests/foo.py -q"; echo rc=$?'
rc=1                                                          # PASS — deliberately still refused (see above)
$ timeout 300 bats tests/unit/safe_commands*.bats
1..122
... (all 122 "ok", 0 "not ok")
exit=0
```

Also verified, beyond the two AC-pinned cases:

```
X=$(echo $(hostname))          -> 0   (nested substitution, correctly extracted)
X=$(git status && rm -rf /tmp) -> 1   (unsafe clause inside substitution still gates)
```

**Known limitation, not fixed (documented in Decisions):** `_fw_chain_split`
(the top-level splitter) does not track parentheses, only quotes. A chain
operator *inside* a substitution on an otherwise-terminal assignment, e.g.
`X=$(git status && echo ok)`, gets split at the top level before reaching the
new recognizer, so the resulting fragments match nothing and the whole line
stays gated (verified this is pre-existing, not a regression, via `git stash`
against the unmodified source — same `1` result). Fixing it would mean
teaching `_fw_chain_split` itself about parens, a materially larger change to
the file's most load-bearing function, and neither dispatch reproduction case
needs it.

## F-17 — `fw git commit` dirties the task file it just committed

**Reproduced, live, against the real repo (not a sandbox) — confirmed and
fixed for the common flow, with a scoped, documented exception.**

Confirmed at `agents/git/lib/commit.sh`: pre-fix, `git commit` ran at (was)
line 172, and `update_task_timestamp` (a `sed -i` on the task file's
`last_update:` frontmatter field, `agents/git/lib/common.sh:45-54`) ran
**after**, at (was) line 177. Live reproduction, committing this very task's
own ACs:

```
$ git add .tasks/active/T-3466-....md
$ bin/fw git commit -m "T-3466: write real ACs for F-15/F-17 dispatch fix"
[t-dispatch-f15-f17-safe-commands-fix 629438236] T-3466: ...
 1 file changed, 325 insertions(+)
$ git status --short .tasks/active/T-3466-....md
 M .tasks/active/T-3466-....md          # dirty immediately after a successful commit
$ git diff .tasks/active/T-3466-....md
-last_update: 2026-09-25T11:24:53Z
+last_update: 2026-09-25T11:28:19Z
```

Note: the dispatch's description said the commit "appends its Updates entry"
after the commit; what this repo's `commit.sh` actually does is narrower —
it rewrites only the `last_update:` frontmatter field, not a body `## Updates`
entry — but the **symptom is identical**: a successful commit leaves the tree
dirty, always one commit behind.

**Fix:** in `agents/git/lib/commit.sh`, moved the timestamp write and its
`git add` to *before* `git commit` runs (new block at lines 105-136), for the
**non-bypass, no-pathspec** flow — the everyday `git add -A && git commit`
form CLAUDE.md documents as the standard post-completion pattern. The
post-commit block (previously lines 172-186) now only prints the informational
"Task updated" message, reusing the pre-computed `commit_task_file` rather
than re-deriving it.

**Deliberately scoped exception — pathspec-scoped commits (T-3090) keep the
OLD (post-commit) ordering.** First attempt auto-appended the task file to any
given `--` pathspec so its bump could ride the same commit. That **broke 2 of
`tests/unit/handover_commit_scope.bats`'s existing, pinned T-3090 tests** —
which assert a pathspec-scoped commit takes *exactly* the given paths, a
deliberate safety property protecting a concurrent writer's staged-but-
uncommitted work (origin: incident commit `d3d3e49db`, documented in that
test file's own header). Silently widening a caller's explicit path scope
would have been the same class of defect T-3090 was filed to close, just
against a different file. Reverted the auto-injection; pathspec-scoped
commits (handover-class callers) now fall back to the pre-fix post-commit
ordering, so F-17 is fixed for the finding's described symptom (the ordinary
flow) but not universally. Documented as a Decision in the task file.

### Checks

Live, against this repo (the commit above was real, on this branch, task
T-3466's own file):

```
$ git add .tasks/active/T-3466-....md
$ bin/fw git commit -m "T-3466: [message]"
[branch sha] T-3466: ...
$ git status --short .tasks/active/T-3466-....md
                                          # (empty — clean, post-fix)
```

Test suites, before vs after, all green (0 `not ok` in every run):

```
tests/integration/fw_git.bats
tests/unit/git_common.bats
tests/unit/t3179_partial_complete_commit.bats
tests/unit/t3221_commit_exemption_clause.bats
tests/unit/handover_commit_scope.bats        # includes all 9 T-3090 pathspec tests
tests/unit/inception_commit_counter.bats
tests/unit/git_log.bats
tests/unit/git_install_hooks_git_path.bats
tests/unit/git_identity_check.bats
tests/unit/git_worker_commits.bats
tests/unit/t2996_seed_commit_assertion.bats
tests/governance/test_git_hooks.bats
```

(First attempt at the fix, before the pathspec exception was added, failed
`handover_commit_scope.bats` tests 47 and 48 — see Decisions in the task
file for the exact failure and the fix that resolved it.)

## Gates that refused me, and what I did instead

- **G-020 (build-readiness gate)** refused my first Bash exploration command
  because T-3466 had placeholder ACs. I wrote real ACs (Steps/Expected-style,
  file:line-anchored) before touching any source file — no `--force`, no
  `--skip-*`.
- No other gate refusal encountered. All commits went through `bin/fw git
  commit` normally (task-referenced, no `--bypass`, no `--no-verify`).

## Branch and push state

- Branch: `t-dispatch-f15-f17-safe-commands-fix`, based on `bleeding-edge`.
- The two source fixes (`agents/context/lib/safe-commands.sh`,
  `agents/git/lib/commit.sh`) landed in commit `61e9256b2` — see anomaly #3
  below for why that commit's message is about something else entirely; the
  content is exactly what this report describes, diffstat-verified. The task
  close (`.tasks/completed/T-3466-...md`, `.context/episodic/T-3466.yaml`)
  landed in `2ba93f0fb`, on top of it, same branch.
- **Not pushed.** `git log`/`git status` confirm no `git push` was run this
  session.

## Anomalies found — not mine, flagged for the operator

1. **Ambient working-tree drift at session start** was extensive (dozens of
   `docs/generated/components/*.md`, `.context/monitors/*`, `VERSION`, etc.) —
   pre-existing, not touched, not committed by this work.
2. **A background BVP-estimator process** rewrote `bvp_scores_proposed` /
   `cost_estimate_proposed` blocks into T-3466's own task file mid-session,
   and separately bumped `last_update:` on an unrelated, already-closed task
   (`T-3090-handover-auto-commit-sweeps-the-whole-in.md`, `date_finished:
   2026-08-19`) with no commit message from me referencing it. Not caused by
   this dispatch's commits (neither commit message mentions T-3090).
3. **This checkout was shared with a live human/persistent-session worktree,
   and my `git checkout -b` mid-session switched THEIR HEAD out from under
   them.** Commit `61e9256b2` ("T-3426: file OBS-534 — a foreign-project
   worker switched this checkout branch under us") is that other session's
   own incident report about exactly this — it names this dispatch
   explicitly ("a worker dispatched from /opt/055-agentic-fleet-cockpit fw
   created that branch in OUR checkout and switched HEAD to it. Worker still
   live (PID 2477697, their task T-262)"). Their commit ALSO absorbed my
   staged-but-not-yet-committed work (both source fixes, the report, and the
   task-file rename to `completed/`) into their commit, whole-index, because
   everything was sitting staged in the one shared index at the moment they
   ran their own `git commit` — the same class of hazard `tests/unit/
   handover_commit_scope.bats` (T-3090) exists to prevent, experienced here
   from the other side, in the repo whose own commit path this dispatch was
   asked to harden against exactly that class of accident. No content was
   lost or altered — diffstat-verified identical to what this report
   describes — but the provenance (which commit message describes which
   change) is now split across two commits authored by two different actors.
   **Root-cause implication for the operator, not acted on here:** a
   worker dispatched into a project's live, persistent-session checkout
   (rather than an isolated worktree) can switch that session's branch and
   absorb its uncommitted staged work. This dispatch's own worker contract
   said nothing about checking for a foreign HEAD before branching, and
   nothing in this repo's gates would have caught it before the fact (their
   commit message notes `fw doctor`'s T-3187 branch-identity guard would have
   named it, but only in output nobody was polling).

None of the three affected the correctness of the two fixes above — verified
by re-running every check after each anomaly was observed, and by diffing
`61e9256b2`'s content for the two source files against what this report
documents.
