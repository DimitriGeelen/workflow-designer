# T-3250 / arc-012 E10 — PRESS THE BRAKE: does the bounded-autonomy ceiling stop the loop?
#
# E9 proved the loop RUNS: 12 tasks closed across 3 budget trips, 7 after the first
# restart. It proved nothing about the loop STOPPING. The arc is named "continuous-run:
# agent-driven compact-resume loop WITH BOUNDED-AUTONOMY CEILING" and only the first
# half has evidence behind it.
#
# Of the three bounds on autonomy — restart budget (wrapper), max_iterations, and
# tier_ceiling — E9 exercised exactly one. It ended on MAX_RESTARTS. `max_iterations`
# was never binding. `tier_ceiling` could not have fired: the ceiling test is
#
#     blast_radius is not None and blast_radius > tier_ceiling_int
#
# and it needs BOTH halves of a join E9 never made. The planned-next-action ref comes
# from the directive's explicit `next_task:` field or the first `T-NNNN` in its prose —
# E9's directive contained neither, so `task_ref` was None. And every E9 backlog task
# was created through the plain verb with no `cost_estimate:`, so `resolve_task_blast_radius`
# would have returned None anyway. Two independent reasons, each sufficient. The run
# reported `last_terminated_reason: ''` and that reading was indistinguishable from a
# ceiling that held.
#
# THAT INDISTINGUISHABILITY IS THE WHOLE DESIGN PROBLEM HERE. An empty
# `last_terminated_reason` is what you see when the brake held AND what you see when the
# brake was never connected. So this script runs TWO legs against the same rig and the
# same dials, differing in ONE number:
#
#     LEG=breach    escalation task carries cost_estimate.blast_radius: 5   (> ceiling 1)
#     LEG=control   escalation task carries cost_estimate.blast_radius: 1   (== ceiling 1)
#
# The control is NOT "a run with no blast-radius". That would fail the ceiling test on
# the `is not None` clause and would prove only that an unresolvable radius is quiet —
# which is E9's result restated. The control resolves a real number that is simply not
# above the ceiling, so the two legs differ in the comparison and nothing else. If both
# come back empty, the guard is disconnected and this script says so.
#
# WHY THE ESCALATION TASK IS LAST IN THE BACKLOG. The ceiling is evaluated by
# `inject-next-directive.py` from the SessionStart hook, which no-ops on a cold start
# (no `.auto-restart-pending` sentinel — T-3168/T-3222). So the FIRST session never sees
# the ceiling at all; the check is only reachable after a real budget trip and a real
# restart. The escalation task therefore has to still be unworked when that restart
# happens, which means it must sit behind enough backlog to outlast one window. It is
# created last, so it holds the highest id, and the directive orders the loop by
# ascending id.
#
# WHY THE DIRECTIVE NAMES EXACTLY ONE TASK. `find_task_reference` takes the FIRST
# `T-NNNN` in the prose. The backlog instructions use a `<ID>` placeholder precisely so
# they contribute no reference, leaving the escalation task as the only one — which is
# what makes it the "planned next action". This is the production path: no framework
# verb writes `next_task:` (grep says so), so the prose route is the only one a real
# operator can take, and it is the one measured here.
#
# WHAT AC 3 NEEDS THAT A FINAL STATE FILE CANNOT GIVE. `.continuous-mode.yaml` holds
# only the last value of `current_iteration`. "The counter froze across the breaching
# transition" is a statement about two adjacent samples, so the run is traced: a
# sampler records (ts, current_iteration, last_terminated_reason, enabled) once a second
# into trace.jsonl, and the assertion reads the sample either side of the transition
# where `last_terminated_reason` first becomes non-empty. Without the trace the freeze
# is inferred; with it, it is observed.
#
# Usage:
#   LEG=breach  bash docs/reports/T-3239-continuous-loop-demo/livefire-brake-tier-ceiling.sh
#   LEG=control bash ...
#   SETUP_ONLY=1 LEG=breach bash ...    build + assert the rig, stop before the loop
#   KEEP_SANDBOX=1 ...                  do not delete the sandbox on exit
#
# The two legs are independent sandboxes and may be run concurrently.

  # justification. It is now false BY DESIGN: the wrapper evaluates the planned next
  # action in a preflight and refuses BEFORE spending the restart, so a working brake
  # produces zero restarts. Asserting `n_restart >= 1` would therefore fail the fix
  # for succeeding.
  #
  # The intent it was a proxy for is unchanged and still worth guarding: the run must
  # actually have REACHED the point where the brake is evaluated, or a green AC4 means
  # only that the loop died early. That intent is now directly measurable -- the
  # wrapper writes an `exit continuous-preflight` ledger event naming the bound -- so
  # the proxy is replaced by the measurement, which is strictly stronger, and both
