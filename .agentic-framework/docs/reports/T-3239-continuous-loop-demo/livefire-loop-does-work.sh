# T-3246 / arc-012 E9 — THE DELIVERABLE: the loop does WORK across a restart.
#
# Everything before this measured the loop's ENGINE. E8 proved a real session
# crosses the real budget threshold and a real wrapper brings a real session back
# — but that session read four files and exited. It closed no task, advanced no
# backlog, produced nothing anyone wanted. Proving the engine turns over with the
# transmission disconnected is not proving the car moves.
#
# The arc's headline mechanic promises the operator a "multi-cycle continuous
# session". The point of a cycle is the WORK in it. So E9 asks the only question
# that matters:
#
#     does the loop CLOSE A TASK, TRIP, RESTART, and CLOSE ANOTHER?
#
# The sandbox therefore carries a real backlog — twelve real tasks created through
# the real verb, each with a tickable AC and a verification line the close gate
# actually runs — and the directive tells the loop to work them. Assertion 3 is
# the deliverable: a task whose date_finished lands AFTER the restart event,
# joined mechanically from task frontmatter and the loop ledger. That is work
# surviving the context boundary, which is the whole arc.
#
# WHY THE WINDOW IS 72000 AND NOT 4000, AND NOT 58000 EITHER. E8 used 4000 so any
# turn tripped it instantly. An instant trip is useless here — the first session
# must get far enough to close something before it dies. But the first E9 run
# showed 58000 was the opposite error, and the arithmetic is the finding:
#
#     useful work per iteration = WINDOW - BASELINE,  not WINDOW
#
# A sandbox session baselines near 52.6k tokens before doing anything (CLAUDE.md,
# hooks, handover), and every restart re-pays that baseline in full — a fresh
# session drops the context it could not afford AND the orientation it had already
# bought. At WINDOW=58000 (critical 55100) that left ~2.5k of headroom, about 4%,
# so the loop cycled correctly and progressed barely: 3 restarts, 1 task closed.
#
# 72000 puts critical at 68400 and headroom at ~15.6k — roughly 6x the first run's
# and the same order as production (300k window, ~50k baseline, ~4.7x headroom).
#
# WHY TWELVE TASKS. The window alone does not decide whether the trip lands
# mid-backlog; the BACKLOG COST does, and the third run measured it:
#
#     baseline 52841 -> final 67471   =  14630 tokens for 5 tasks  (~2926/task)
#     headroom  68400 - 52841         =  15559 tokens
#     tasks per window                =  15559 / 2926  ~= 5.3
#
# So five tasks is almost exactly ONE window's worth. That run consumed 94% of
# the headroom, finished the whole backlog, and stopped 929 tokens short of
# critical — it never tripped, and assertions 1 and 3 failed for the OPPOSITE
# reason to run 2: too much headroom for the work, not too little.
#
# Both failures are the same mistake in different directions: sizing one of
# {window, backlog} without reference to the other. What has to be true is a
# RATIO — the backlog must outlast the window, which is the arc's whole premise
# (work that does not fit in one context). 12 tasks is ~2.3 windows, so the trip
# lands near task 5-6 with real closes on both sides.
#
# If you change WINDOW, re-derive N_BACKLOG from the per-task cost. Do not nudge
# one and leave the other.
#
# Usage: bash docs/reports/T-3239-continuous-loop-demo/livefire-loop-does-work.sh
#        SETUP_ONLY=1 bash ...   build the sandbox, assert the rig, stop before the loop
#        KEEP_SANDBOX=1 bash ...   do not delete the sandbox on exit
#
# NOTE on KEEP_SANDBOX: kept sandboxes accumulate under /tmp/tmp.*/proj and are
# never reaped. If you go looking for "the" sandbox afterwards, `ls -d
# /tmp/tmp.*/proj | head -1` gives you the OLDEST one, not this run's - which
# reads as a completed run with a stale ledger. Sort by mtime, or take the path
# this script prints.

# Every step below used to end in `>/dev/null 2>&1`, and four of them were failing
# silently in every E9 run up to and including the 2026-09-01 22:25 run:
#
#   1. `fw task create` was called with only --name/--type. Non-interactively it
#      also requires --description and --owner, so it created NOTHING and said so
#      only on the stderr we were discarding.
#   2. The AC-graft below globs .tasks/active/T-*.md. With no backlog created,
#      that glob matched `fw init`'s onboarding curriculum (T-001..T-005) and
#      grafted item1..item5 onto THOSE.
#   3. The verification graft anchors on "## RCA". The onboarding template has no
#      such section, so the anchor never matched and NO task in any run ever
#      carried a verification line. The close gate had nothing to run.
#   4. `git commit -m "baseline: ..."` carries no T-XXX, so fw init's own
#      commit-msg hook rejected it. The sandbox had no baseline commit.
#
# None of it surfaced, because BACKLOG counted whatever was in .tasks/active/ and
# got 5 either way. The header line "backlog: 5 real tasks" was true of the wrong
# five. That is the false-green shape this whole arc keeps meeting: a check that
# answers a question next to the one it appears to answer.
#
# So: no step here is allowed to fail quietly, and the population is asserted by
# NAME, not by count.
