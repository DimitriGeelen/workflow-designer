## What the previous worker left, verified and fixed

| Found | Fix |
|---|---|
| Any non-empty bearer token accepted; env-var fallback | `hmac.compare_digest` against `receiver.token` (`lib/sidecar/http_server.py:55-60`) |
| Token written AFTER the port opened (T-3475: before) | token first (`lib/sidecar_cli.py:451`); server refuses without one (`http_server.py:131-148`) |
| Prompt hook marked HANDED_OVER before printing; errors to `/dev/null` | `lib/sidecar/hooks.py` (below) |
| No injection code | `lib/sidecar/inject.py` |
| Reused id with different content accepted, and a test asserting that | content hash → `conflict` (`receiver.py`); test now asserts rejection |
| `tests/unit/t3561_e2e_nonce.py` wrote agent B's reply itself | deleted (`801c9c253`) |

## Acceptance criteria

### AC1 — `fw sidecar receiver start|stop|status` — **MET**
- `lib/sidecar_cli.py:428` start: writes the 0600 token FIRST (`:451` →
  `lifecycle.write_token`, created `O_EXCL` 0600). It then spawns `lib/sidecar/http_server.py`,
  which refuses to bind without the token (`http_server.py:142-148`). After binding it writes the
  pid/port/url triple-file and a host registry entry. The CLI waits for `/health`.
- `:489` stop: SIGTERM, wait, SIGKILL only if needed; removes the triple-file and the registry entry.
- `:517` status: pid/port/url, `/health`, inject enabled, awaiting count, ready flag.
- Tests (`tests/unit/test_sidecar_receiver_t3693.py`, real receiver subprocesses):
  `test_receiver_start_writes_token_0600_triple_file_and_registry`,
  `test_receiver_status_reports_pid_port_url_and_health`, `test_receiver_stop_is_clean`,
  `test_server_refuses_to_open_a_port_without_a_token`.

### AC2 — Stop sets ready; UserPromptSubmit clears it FIRST, then surfaces — **MET**
- `lib/sidecar/hooks.py:79` `stop()` → `adapter.set_ready_for_input(True)`.
- `hooks.py:147` `prompt()`: `:153` clears ready first. It then emits the stored, not-yet-handed-over
  messages as `additionalContext` framed as untrusted data (PEER-DATA markers that a body cannot
  close early), flushes (`:164`), starts the detached finalizer (`:172`) and exits.
- The ready-flag write is an atomic replace with **no fsync** (`lib/sidecar/adapter.py:53`).
  See §Round 3 for why.
- Wrappers `agents/context/sidecar-receiver-ready.sh` / `sidecar-receiver-adapter.sh` pass stdin
  through and log errors to `.context/sidecar/receiver/hook-errors.log`.
- Tests: `test_stop_hook_sets_ready_via_fw_hook` (real `bin/fw hook`),
  `test_prompt_hook_clears_ready_before_reading_messages` (a spy at the read sees `ready=False`),
  `test_prompt_hook_surfaces_untrusted_then_hands_over_and_confirms`,
  `test_prompt_hook_via_fw_hook_wrapper_exits_fast_and_finalizes` (real wrapper, real detached finalizer).

### AC3 — registered in `.claude/settings.json` + consumer template; baseline — **MET**
- `.claude/settings.json:241` (Stop, alongside `stop-driver.sh`), `:256` (UserPromptSubmit,
  alongside `sidecar-inbox`); `lib/init.sh:1234` and `:1239-1249`.
- `bin/fw enforcement baseline` re-run (`801c9c253`). `bin/fw enforcement status` →
  `✓ Baseline set (e19fd6564856929a...)`; codex recomputed the hash independently in both rounds.
- `stop_driver.bats` 19/19 ok; `upgrade_fresh_machine_simulation.bats` 13/13 ok (required for
  `lib/init.sh` edits). Test: `test_hooks_registered_in_settings_and_consumer_template`.

### AC4 — ONE line injected when pending + ready; HANDED_OVER only when the hook actually surfaced it — **MET**
(The AC wording was corrected to the operator directive; see the task's `## Decisions`.)
- `lib/sidecar/inject.py:129` `_deliver_locked`, under an flock. It resolves the session by the
  `fw-project=<sha256(root)[:16]>` tag that `bin/claude-fw:70-101` now registers, else a
  `claude`-tagged session with cwd == project root. Zero or several matches → no inject, and an
  INJECT_BLOCKED event records why (`:80` "refusing to guess"). Readiness is cleared before typing
  (`:156`), then one `termlink pty inject <session> <line> --enter` (`:159`).
- **One line, guaranteed** (round-2 finding 1): ids must match `[A-Za-z0-9_:-]{1,128}` at
  ingress (`receiver.py:57`, so a newline id → HTTP 400 REJECTED), and `injection_line`
  (`inject.py:104`) strips every id to `[A-Za-z0-9-]` again and asserts the line is printable.
  The line never carries peer content. Tests: `test_unsafe_ids_rejected_at_ingress[×8]`,
  `test_unsafe_id_rejected_over_real_http`, `test_injection_line_is_one_printable_line_whatever_the_ids`.
- **HANDED_OVER** is written only by `hooks.finalize` (`hooks.py:236`). It runs only when the
  session transcript (`transcript_path` from the hook input) holds a `hook_additional_context`
  attachment carrying THIS attempt's exact block header, i.e. the harness's own record that the
  model was given it. The injector records INJECT_ATTEMPT only; printing records nothing. With no
  evidence → HANDOVER_UNCONFIRMED (`:268`), and the message is released
  (`.injected`/`.surfacing` removed) for re-surfacing and re-injection.
- **Evidence is bound to the surfacing attempt** (codex round-3 finding: the old predicate accepted
  `[msg <id>]` anywhere in an attachment, so an id quoted inside another message's untrusted body,
  or an attachment from an earlier attempt, could certify a message the model never saw). Each
  prompt-hook run mints `secrets.token_hex(16)` (`hooks.py:173`), puts it in every block header
  (`_header`, `:87`: `## from S  [conversation C]  [msg ID]  [surfacing TOKEN]`), writes it to
  the message's surfacing marker and passes it to the detached finalizer (`--surfacing`, `:188`).
  `_in_transcript` (`:195`) accepts only that exact header as a whole line followed immediately by
  the `<<<PEER-DATA` opener. A peer body cannot forge a token it never sees, and an earlier
  attempt carries a different token. Tests: `test_id_quoted_in_another_messages_body_is_not_evidence`
  (codex's repro, plus a forged header line with a guessed token),
  `test_attachment_from_an_earlier_attempt_does_not_certify_a_later_one`,
  `test_finalize_cli_takes_the_attempt_token`. **Mutation check:** with the old predicate restored,
  the first two FAIL; restored, all pass. Live: B's transcript in the final run holds
  `[msg a0197742-…]  [surfacing bb291e02155842ce3e52e409a53a0c07]`, and B's receiver recorded
  `HANDED_OVER evidence: transcript:ea398e94-….jsonl`.
- Triggers: on store (`http_server.py:107`) and `fw sidecar deliver-pending` (`sidecar_cli.py:544`).
  Urgent bypasses readiness (`inject.py:142`).
- Unit (termlink binary stubbed; injector real): `test_inject_one_line_when_ready_and_never_hand_over`,
  `test_no_inject_when_not_ready`, `test_urgent_bypasses_readiness`,
  `test_no_matching_session_leaves_message_flagged[×2]`, `test_two_matching_sessions_refuse_to_guess`,
  `test_cwd_fallback_matches_claude_session`, `test_injection_disabled_blocks`,
  `test_no_transcript_evidence_means_no_hand_over_and_release`,
  `test_finalizer_waits_for_the_transcript_to_catch_up`.
- Live, real TermLink: `tests/integration/t3693_sidecar_e2e_test.py::test_real_termlink_inject_reaches_the_tagged_session`
  drives the real `bin/fw sidecar deliver-pending` CLI into a real tagged PTY. The line appears;
  INJECT_ATTEMPT, no HANDED_OVER. PASSED.
- Live e2e: every HANDED_OVER carries `evidence: transcript:<session>.jsonl`:
  ```
  A STORED · A INJECT_ATTEMPT on-store · A HANDED_OVER transcript:17c6e96d-….jsonl · A CONFIRM_SENT
  B STORED · B INJECT_ATTEMPT on-store · B HANDED_OVER transcript:ea398e94-….jsonl · B CONFIRM_SENT
  ```

### AC5 — REAL e2e: two real Claude sessions; A generates the nonce; B's prompt never mentions it — **MET**
`tests/integration/t3693_sidecar_e2e_test.py::test_e2e_two_real_agents_nonce_round_trip`
- Two scratch projects, each running `fw sidecar receiver start`, with a `.claude/settings.json`
  that registers only the two framework hooks, and a real `bin/claude-fw --termlink --no-restart
  --model sonnet hello` session found through its `fw-project` tag.
- **A generates the nonce in its own session** (`:301` operator instruction). A ran
  `N=$(head -c 4096 /dev/urandom | tr -dc a-z | head -c 12); … fw sidecar send … --body "Nonce check $N: …"`.
  **The test never chooses the nonce.** It learns it by observing B's receiver store (`:176`).
- **B's only prompts: `hello` and the injected `[sidecar] …` line.** In the final run (`0fjxqv`, against `53891a246`)
  B's model replied to `t3693a-0fjxqv` with `MPDCEUHPVCKJ`, and A's model said: *"The peer replied
  `MPDCEUHPVCKJ`. That is my nonce `mpdceuhpvckj` in uppercase, so the check passed."*
  (`docs/reports/T-3693-e2e-transcript-excerpts.txt`, extracted from both agents' own Claude Code
  session transcripts for this run, lines 1-24; negative run lines 25-40).
- **The pass condition** (`:332`): the UPPERCASE string, which the test never writes, must be in
  A's receiver store AND in A's transcript inside the PEER-DATA block of a
  `hook_additional_context` attachment (`_surfaced_in_transcript`, `:151`).
- Captured (`docs/reports/T-3693-e2e-run.log`, `T-3693-e2e-positive-evidence.json`):
  ```
  [t3693-e2e 04:15:15] observed A's nonce on the wire at B's receiver: mpdceuhpvckj
  "elapsed_s": 11.6,
  "transformed_nonce_in_A_receiver": "740dae31-51f2-40bb-9deb-4046cd066937",
  "transformed_nonce_in_A_context": "17c6e96d-c89d-4f54-8139-d11f9297873b.jsonl [hook_additional_context] PEER-DATA block: 'MPDCEUHPVCKJ'",
  PASSED
  ```
- Reliability after the round-3 fix: 5/5 positive runs passed (12.5, 17.7, 11.8, 11.5, 11.6 s) in
  round 2; round-3 re-runs passed at 11.5 s (before `53891a246`) and 11.6 s (after, above).
  All injections were `on-store`; the harness's 5 s `deliver-pending` loop (labelled as T-3684's
  stand-in) never had to deliver.

### AC6 — negative control: injection disabled → FAIL, sender sees ESCALATED — **MET**
`::test_e2e_negative_control_injection_disabled_fails_and_escalates` runs the SAME
`run_round_trip()` with B's receiver started `--no-inject`. It asserts that A's nonce reached B's
receiver, that `not result.passed`, and that A's ledger reads SENT → RECEIVED → ESCALATED with no
HANDED_OVER and no REPLIED, set by infrastructure.
- Captured (`T-3693-e2e-negative-evidence.json`, final run `sx5gtg`): A generated `tvcktsiqquvq`, and it reached B's
  receiver. A's ledger `SENT/sender, RECEIVED/receiver-response, ESCALATED/infrastructure`. B's
  events: STORED, then INJECT_BLOCKED "injection disabled (receiver started with --no-inject)"
  on-store and on every tick. B's transcript: only `hello`. A said "I haven't seen a reply yet."
  PASSED.

### AC7 — sender ledger SENT → RECEIVED → HANDED_OVER → REPLIED, each by the party that can know it — **MET**
`lib/sidecar/direct.py`:
- SENT by the sender (`:191`); RECEIVED from the receiver's HTTP response (`:205`).
- HANDED_OVER only through `confirm_from_peer` (`:235`), reached through our receiver's `/ack`
  (`http_server.py:81`). The peer's finalizer posts that only after transcript evidence. It is
  accepted only if this ledger SENT the id, the confirming peer IS the original recipient, and the
  message is not already HANDED_OVER/REPLIED.
- REPLIED only through `note_reply` (`:258`), by our own receiver, and only from the original recipient.
- **Out-of-order rows cannot regress the state** (round-2 finding 2). The rows come from three
  processes and may arrive out of order: the peer can confirm before our send call writes
  RECEIVED. The state is therefore the **highest-ranked** row (`RANK`, `:57`; `_effective`,
  `:110`), not the newest, so a late RECEIVED never undoes HANDED_OVER/REPLIED and the sweep never
  escalates a handled message. A late HANDED_OVER after ESCALATED still counts (truth arriving
  late). The ledger keeps every row in arrival order.
- Tests: `test_received_then_replied_ledger_order`, `test_confirm_only_from_the_original_recipient`,
  `test_late_or_repeated_confirm_never_regresses`, `test_late_confirm_after_escalation_is_recorded`,
  `test_reply_only_from_the_original_recipient`, `test_peer_cannot_confirm_an_unknown_message`,
  `test_late_received_never_regresses_a_handed_over`, `test_late_received_never_regresses_a_reply`,
  and (round 3) `test_peer_confirm_and_reply_racing_ahead_of_send_over_real_http`.
- **Round-3: the race through the real path.** Codex round 2 noted the late-RECEIVED tests seed rows
  by hand. The round-3 test starts two REAL receiver processes and calls the REAL `direct.send()`.
  After the real POST `/message` to B returns RECEIVED, but before `send()` writes its RECEIVED row,
  B's real CONFIRM-2 (`hooks._confirm` → real POST `/ack` to A's receiver process) and B's real reply
  (`direct.send` → A's receiver `/message` → `note_reply`) land in A's ledger. Only the code under
  test runs; the one wrapper merely delays when `send()` sees its own response. Asserted: rows in
  arrival order `SENT, HANDED_OVER, REPLIED, RECEIVED` (by `peer-receiver:t3693-b` / `own-receiver`),
  effective state REPLIED, the sweep (with the late row's deadline already past) escalates nothing,
  and a further CONFIRM-2 is refused. **Mutation check:** with `_effective` changed to
  latest-row-wins, this test and both late-RECEIVED tests FAIL (3 failed); restored, they pass.
  Scope of this test: it proves ledger ordering under the race. It calls `hooks._confirm` directly
  and sends a scripted reply, so it proves neither hook surfacing nor an agent-written reply; those
  are proved only by the live e2e (AC5).
- Live (round-3 run): A's ledger `[SENT/sender, RECEIVED/receiver-response, HANDED_OVER/peer-receiver:t3693b-0fjxqv,
  REPLIED/own-receiver]`.
- Trust model: same-host. The peer authenticates with our 0600 token, and its name is checked
  against the SENT row. Cross-host signed identity is T-3688.

### AC8 — UNDELIVERABLE, REJECTED, ESCALATED — **MET**
- UNDELIVERABLE (`direct.py:218`): `test_receiver_down_spends_budget_then_undeliverable` SIGKILLs a
  real receiver (its registry entry survives, as after a crash) → 3 attempts, 2 backoffs.
- REJECTED: wrong token → real 401, `test_bad_token_rejected_never_stored_never_injected` (nothing
  stored, so nothing can be injected); id reuse → 409; unsafe id → 400.
- ESCALATED: `escalate_expired` (`:291`) via `fw sidecar sweep`;
  `test_escalated_by_sweep_when_handover_deadline_passes` (real CLI); live in AC6.
- Every non-success row also goes to `.context/sidecar/refusals.jsonl` for T-3555 (unshipped).
  The handoff note is appended to `.tasks/active/T-3555-*.md`.

### AC9 — all tests pass — **MET**
```
$ python3 -m pytest tests/integration/t3693_*.py -v -s
…::test_real_termlink_inject_reaches_the_tagged_session PASSED
…::test_e2e_two_real_agents_nonce_round_trip PASSED

$ python3 -m pytest tests/unit/test_sidecar_receiver_t3693.py tests/unit/t3561_adapter.py tests/unit/t3561_receiver_storage.py -q
60 passed
```
The live tests skip loudly ("T-3693 LIVE E2E NOT RUN … a skip here proves nothing") when
termlink, claude or tmux is missing, and the Verification line refuses `SKIPPED`.

### AC10 — vendor check, baseline, lint — **MET**
`bin/fw vendor self --check` → `in sync` (rc 0). `bats tests/lint/` → 118 ok, 0 not ok (re-run
before the final commit). Baseline: AC3.

---

## Round 3 — a defect the live runs found (not raised by codex)

With the round-2 code, 2 of 8 positive runs failed. The PTY capture now in the evidence
(`docs/reports/T-3693-e2e-failed-run-hook-timeout.json`) showed B's screen:
*"UserPromptSubmit hook [fw hook sidecar-receiver-adapter] timed out after 30s — output
discarded"*. B saw only the notice, and A's ledger (correctly) went to ESCALATED. B's files showed
the hook had printed and written `.pending` (HANDED_OVER) at 03:22:54.29, then stalled in the next
fsync (btrfs, load average ~28). **So the receiver held a false HANDED_OVER for a message the model
never received, and it would never have been re-delivered.** The root cause: Claude Code uses a
hook's stdout only if the process exits within its timeout, so any record written inside the hook
is premature.

Fix: no fsync on the hook's critical path (`adapter.py:53`). The hook prints and exits. A detached
finalizer records HANDED_OVER only on the transcript's own `hook_additional_context` evidence,
otherwise HANDOVER_UNCONFIRMED plus release (AC4). After the fix: 5/5 positive runs, and the full
file passed (3/3).

## Review findings → changes

| Round | Finding | Change |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | AC5: harness generated the nonce | A generates it; test observes it on the wire |
| 1 | AC5: loose transcript match | strict attachment + PEER-DATA block check |
| 1 | AC7: any peer could confirm; regressions; any sender REPLIED | recipient identity + no-regression in `confirm_from_peer` / `note_reply` |
| 1 | legacy t3561 tests overclaimed | deleted/replaced/renamed (`test_adapter_set_ready_for_input`, `test_adapter_clear_ready_for_input`, `test_missing_or_unreadable_flag_reads_not_ready`, `test_hostile_payload_stored_verbatim`) |
| 1 | `deliver-pending` CLI only tested empty | live TermLink leg now goes through the real CLI |
| 1 | T-3555 handoff unconfirmed | Updates notes appended to T-3555 and T-3684 |
| 2 | AC4: ids could carry a newline into the "one line" | ingress charset + sanitised, asserted-printable line |
| 2 | AC7: late RECEIVED could regress HANDED_OVER/REPLIED | effective state = highest rank |
| 3 (live) | hook killed after printing → false HANDED_OVER | transcript-evidenced detached finalizer; no fsync in the hook path |
| 3 | AC4/AC7: `[msg ID]` anywhere in an attachment (incl. another message's body, or an earlier attempt) certified hand-over | per-attempt surfacing token; exact header line + PEER-DATA opener; 3 tests, mutation-checked; live re-run |
| 3 | round-2 race tests seeded rows by hand | `test_peer_confirm_and_reply_racing_ahead_of_send_over_real_http`: real `send()`, two real receivers, mutation-checked |

## Scope fence — every deferral, owner exists and is active

| Not built here | Owner | Check |
|---|---|---|
| 30 s tick driver (R3); this slice provides `fw sidecar deliver-pending` for it | **T-3684** | `.tasks/active/T-3684-*.md`, handoff note appended |
| Urgent bypass as a register row (R5). The inject-time bypass exists (`inject.py:142`) | **T-3684** | register R5 `owner_task: T-3684` |
| Always-on per-agent sidecar / liveness (R7, R14, R15) | **T-3685** | `.tasks/active/T-3685-*.md` |
| Cross-host delivery and signed peer identity | **T-3688** | `.tasks/active/T-3688-*.md` |
| Consumer rollout (template entries ARE added to `lib/init.sh`) | **T-3689** | `.tasks/active/T-3689-*.md` |
| Refusal ledger ingestion of `.context/sidecar/refusals.jsonl` | **T-3555** | `.tasks/active/T-3555-*.md`, handoff note appended |
| Register rows R2/R4/R6 → `built` (document owned by T-3694; this task may not edit it) | **T-3694**, asked via `fw sidecar send` (conversation `t3693-register-rows`) | see below |

**Register state at writing.** `python3 lib/design_register.py close-check` reports R2, R4 and R6
as "owned by T-3693 and still in-progress/partial". All three are built (R2 = AC4 on-store
injection; R4 = AC2; R6 = AC7). Only the document is stale; its owner has been asked to mark them
built, and has not answered yet. **T-3693 does not close until that check is clean.**

## Not mine, found on the way (pre-existing, not fixed here)

`tests/unit/sidecar_audit_rail.bats` has 6 failures. The nightly record already lists them
(`.context/audits/unit-suite/LATEST.yaml:442`). The cause is T-3561's `INJECTED_NOW`→`HUB_ACCEPTED`
rename: `lib/sidecar-audit.sh:48` still counts `INJECTED_NOW`. Neither file is touched by T-3693.
