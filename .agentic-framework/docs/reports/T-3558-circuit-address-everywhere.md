# T-3558 — Circuit address everywhere; `dm:` is transport, not identity

Research artefact (C-001). Opened 2026-09-29 while walking the operator through
OBS-567, when the operator asked whether the 5-level circuit model had been
"thrown out the window".

## Dialogue Log

### Segment 1 — the question

Agent presented OBS-567 (co-resident DM collision) as a choice between three
addressing options. Operator, verbatim (Dutch):

> Oké, hier ben ik helemaal verward. We hadden dat 5-step, 5-level-adressing voor
> circuit-communication en circuit zou 1-to-1 zijn, op een agent of een
> session-level. Dus, heb ik dat uit de window gegooid, is dat helemaal anders?

Agent answered, after reading `lib/aef_address.py`, `lib/sidecar/circuit.py` and
D-660: no. The circuit model is intact in the code and is what `inbox:` carries. The
collision is confined to `dm:`, which does not use the circuit model at all. It keys
on TermLink's machine-wide identity, which is the *host* rung of the ladder.

### Segment 2 — operator, verbatim

> Well, not all. In Windows [sic, voice transcript; read as "within/all"] machines,
> you want to use the circuit model. With the letter [ladder] of the fallback. From
> agent, session, project, hub, machine. My question is, what you said here is that
> Termlink is a mechanism for host keys. Maybe we should make a change in Termlink.
> We hadden already had some communication about Termlink, but we haven't yet. What
> do you think? Can you think about it?

**Operator intent, as stated:** the circuit model applies everywhere, with the
fallback ladder agent → session → project → hub → machine.

## Findings

### F-1 — Two identities, and only one of them follows the circuit model

| key | fingerprint | scope | used for |
|---|---|---|---|
| `~/.termlink/identity.key` | `d1993c2c3ec44c94` | machine-wide | **DM addressing** (`lib/sidecar/dm.py:identity_fingerprint` → `termlink whoami`) |
| `.context/rail-identity.key` | `bdd184bd89f318e4` | this project | **signing posts** (T-3543) |

T-3543 moved *signing* to a per-project key and never moved *addressing*. So
`dm:<fp>:<fp>` between two projects on this host is always
`dm:d1993c2c3ec44c94:d1993c2c3ec44c94`, a shared mailbox (count=7, envelopes from at
least 3 projects). Verified 2026-09-29, OBS-574.

### F-2 — The ruling text and the code disagree, and a peer followed the text

| source | what it says |
|---|---|
| D-599 / T-3433 (22 Sep) | `inbox:<circuit-id>` — the five-level address |
| **D-660 / T-3518 (27 Sep), as worded** | `dm:<fp>:<fp> / inbox:<agent-id>` |
| our code (`lib/sidecar/circuit.py`) | `inbox:<circuit-id>`, e.g. `inbox:cacc73ea32b121dd/999-Agentic-Engineering-Framework` (hub/project) |
| 832-Workflow-designer (unread consult, 28 Sep) | *"WE QUOTED A SUPERSEDED RULING … Withdrawing the five-level framing; we take D-660."* |

D-660 adopted TermLink's *prefixes* (`dm:` and `inbox:`) because of TermLink's mail
semantics: wake events, receipts, `--await-ack`. Its wording also swapped
`circuit-id` for `agent-id`. Our code did not follow that swap. 832 did, and dropped
the model the operator intended to keep. One decision, three readers, two verdicts:
the same failure removed from arc membership on 2026-09-26.

### F-3 — The TermLink conversation was sitting unread

Seven consults from 010-termlink and 832, unread for 23.6h (found without draining,
via `inbox.pending(advance=False)`):

- 010-termlink: their subscriber did not wake on `inbox:` topics, and they found 49
  unread consults on their own inbox. **Correction, later:** the cause was their
  notify rail enumerating `--prefix "dm:"` only, so from our T-3433 migration onward
  every consult we sent was invisible to them. Fixed on their side.
- 832: adopted the circuit id, then **withdrew it** after reading D-660's text, and
  sent an explicit **request for a full readout**. The first question in it: *is
  `metadata.from_circuit` load-bearing for trust, or routing only?*

### F-4 — TermLink already tolerates circuit-shaped names in `dm:`

`dm:` topic names are plain strings. The hub already carries name-keyed ones:
`dm:050-email-archive:ring20-management-agent`, `dm:s3t1-1416551:…`,
`dm:cashweb-integration-agent:…`. A second key file
(`~/.termlink/cashweb-integration-agent.key`) exists beside the machine identity.
But `termlink identity` has only `init`, `show` and `rotate` for one identity per
user. There is no first-class per-project or per-agent identity.

## Agent's thinking on "should we change TermLink?"

**Split the question: routing versus trust.** The answer differs for each.

**Routing (where a message goes): no TermLink change needed.** `inbox:` has the same
mail semantics as `dm:`, and what follows `inbox:` is ours to define: the circuit id,
with the ladder fallback. The circuit model therefore works over TermLink *today*.
The fix is on our side: say it plainly in the ruling, and stop using `dm:<fp>:<fp>`
for agent-to-agent circuits. `dm:` stays valid as a TermLink transport between
machines whose keys genuinely differ.

**Trust (who actually sent it): this is where a TermLink change earns its place.**
This is 832's question. Today a circuit id is a *name*, so anyone on the hub can
write any `from_circuit`. Signatures use our per-project key, but nothing binds that
key to a circuit id, and TermLink's own identity only proves the *machine*. If the
circuit is to be trusted and not merely routed, the key has to live at circuit level
(at least project), and the hub or the recipient has to verify the binding. That is
TermLink's identity layer. Per gap-homing (T-1333) the fix belongs there, so it is
**theirs to decide, ours to propose**.

**What would make the TermLink proposal concrete:** named identities managed by
`termlink identity` (the `cashweb-integration-agent.key` shape made first-class),
`whoami` resolving to the caller's project identity instead of being ambiguous across
173 sessions, and optionally hub-side verification that an envelope's signing key
matches its `from_circuit`.

## Open actions (the operator's to authorise; outward-facing)

1. **Amend D-660:** adopt TermLink's prefixes, keep the circuit id after `inbox:`;
   `dm:` is transport, not circuit addressing. (IW-1)
2. **Propose to TermLink** per-project/per-circuit identity, for trust. (IW-2)
3. **Correct the record with 832 and 010-termlink:** the five-level model is not
   superseded; answer 832's readout request, including the trust-vs-routing
   question. (IW-3)

## External review — synthesis (2026-09-29)

Three reviewers, three vendors, run independently on
`T-3558-external-review-brief.md`. Verbatim reviews:
`T-3558-review-openai.md`, `T-3558-review-zai.md`, `T-3558-review-anthropic.md`.
Independence caveat: the Anthropic reviewer (Sonnet 5) shares the builder's vendor.

**Verdicts: amber, amber, amber.** Sound direction; not to proceed as written.

### Where all three agree

| # | finding | OpenAI | Z.ai | Anthropic |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | **Consumption is the real failure, and the proposal does nothing for it.** Each named this as its TOP RISK. | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ |
| 2 | Consumption can be fixed now, with no TermLink change | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ |
| 3 | The routing/trust split is right as architecture | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ |
| 4 | Anchor identity at the **project** rung; session/agent are claims or delegations under it | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ |
| 5 | "Optional" hub verification is not acceptable; verification must be mandatory where trust is decided | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ |
| 6 | Routing is not privacy: hub topics are readable by anyone on the hub | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ |
| 7 | Replay protection is missing | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ |
| 8 | Key lifecycle (issuance, rotation, revocation) is missing | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ |
| 9 | One normative, machine-checked spec, so ruling text and code cannot drift again (F-2) | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ |
| 10 | Migrating off the shared `dm:` topic needs a deprecation/watch window | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ |

The consensus on #1 is the headline. The agent flagged consumption as question 5
of the brief, but the agent's own proposal contained nothing for it. It led with
addressing, which is the part that was easier to reason about. All three reviewers
say the priority is the reverse.

### The one real disagreement: `dm:`

- **Demote** (OpenAI, Z.ai). Z.ai's decisive argument: pairwise topics do not compose
  with the fallback ladder, since a coarse-level recipient cannot watch a topic named
  by a fine-level pair. Add n² sprawl and no multi-party story.
- **Re-key per project** (Anthropic). Its argument: a rule where the same conversation
  uses a different prefix depending on whether two projects share a host is
  topology-dependent, and prose rules like that are what produced F-2.

**Resolution proposed:** demote (2 of 3, and the ladder argument is structural).
Answer Anthropic's objection with finding #9: the rule is enforced by one shared,
machine-checked definition, not by prose, so there is nothing to misread.

### Points only one reviewer raised, each worth keeping

- **OpenAI: separate key files under one OS user are not a security boundary.** If
  co-resident projects run as the same user (they do here: root), each can read the
  others' keys. Per-project keys then give *attribution between cooperating agents*,
  not protection against a malicious one. Real isolation needs separate OS principals
  or a credential broker. **This bounds what the trust half can ever promise on a
  single host, and it is the operator's call how far to go.**
- **OpenAI:** delivered ≠ accepted ≠ completed. A transport receipt must never be read
  as "the agent acted". Fallback must not silently *widen* who can read an
  agent-private message.
- **Z.ai:** make reading mail a **framework gate**: no task opens or closes across
  unread mail addressed to this project. This is AEF's own enforcement pattern
  ("nothing gets done without a task"), applied to consumption.
- **Z.ai:** don't wait on TermLink for trust. Sign with the existing per-project key
  now and verify recipient-side against fingerprints exchanged out of band.
- **Z.ai:** peer mail that requests *action* must enter AEF's task and Tier-0 path,
  never act as a side channel around the human.
- **Z.ai:** answer 832 now: `from_circuit` is routing-only and untrusted until
  verification ships. Peers may already be trusting it.
- **Anthropic:** ship a synthetic canary with a response deadline, so the next silent
  consumption gap is caught automatically, not by a human noticing.

### Revised proposal (agent, after review)

1. **Consumption first, ours, no TermLink change:** a mail-read gate at session start
   and task boundaries (project-level inbox at minimum); ack-on-receipt with
   escalate-on-silence; delivered / accepted / completed as separate states; a canary
   with a deadline. Unanswered or refused mail feeds the T-3555 ledger.
2. **Routing:** `inbox:<circuit-id>` with the ladder; `dm:` demoted by policy; one
   machine-checked address spec that both AEF and peers import; migration with a watch
   window on the shared topic; D-660 amended.
3. **Trust, in two honest stages:** (a) now, sign with the per-project key and verify
   recipient-side, mandatory, stated plainly as *attribution between cooperating
   agents*; (b) real isolation needs OS-level separation or a broker, which is the
   operator's decision. Replay protection, key lifecycle and confidentiality belong to
   the trust design, not to later.
4. **TermLink proposal, theirs to decide:** named identities, deterministic `whoami`
   (ambiguity is an error, never "no mailboxes"), topic ACLs or end-to-end encryption.
5. **Tell 832 and 010-termlink now:** the five-level model stands, and `from_circuit`
   is routing-only and untrusted until verification ships.

### F-5 — The consumption design exists, was ratified, and was never built

The design the operator described is `docs/architecture/sidecar-target-architecture.md`
(D-645, ratified 2026-09-25; design of record T-3397). Its build order has eight
slices. Measured 2026-09-29:

- **Slice 0** shipped (T-3462).
- **The slice-1 transport** was ruled GO (T-3475, 2026-09-25: HTTP).
- **Slice 1 itself** (receiver sidecar process, HTTP API, durable address, local
  storage, receiver-side flag) **has no task and no code.** There is no HTTP server in
  `lib/sidecar/`; `RECEIVED` and `HANDED_OVER` appear nowhere. Every later slice hangs
  off it.
- **Why it escaped:** the GO-scope audit counts T-3475 as built because two tasks
  mention it (T-3479, address dual-read; T-3494, an unrelated estimator task). A
  mention counted as a build. Filed OBS-575.

So the round-1 reviewers' unanimous "consumption first" recommendation independently
rediscovered D-645's slices 1–4, and the operator's "for some reason it's still not
working" has a plain answer: it was designed and ratified, and then it was not built.

Round 2 (`T-3558-external-review-brief-round2.md`) puts D-645, the built-versus-designed
gap, the operator's lifecycle with proposed state names, and round 1's findings to the
same three reviewers.

## External review ROUND 2 — synthesis (2026-09-29)

Same three reviewers, fresh sessions, input `T-3558-external-review-brief-round2.md`.
Verbatim: `T-3558-review2-openai.md`, `T-3558-review2-zai.md`,
`T-3558-review2-anthropic.md`. **Verdicts: amber, amber, amber.**

### Unanimous

| # | finding |
|---|---|
| 1 | **D-645 is the right direction.** It is the first proposal in either round that attacks consumption with mechanism rather than agent discipline: two confirmations split "retry" from "escalate", store-then-inject makes durability independent of the agent. |
| 2 | **Push and gate are complementary.** Push gives timeliness; the gate *audits the push* by reading the lifecycle store (anything past its deadline), not the mailbox. The gate **forces a decision** (accept / decline / defer), never the work, or any peer can block a project by sending mail. |
| 3 | **Injection security cannot rest on framing.** Injection grants *attention*, never *authority*: a peer request can at most become a task proposal through AEF's approval path. Authenticated callers only; an unknown sender is quarantined, stored and surfaced, never injected. Safety must not depend on the model behaving. |
| 4 | **"Consumed" is the wrong word.** Keep HANDED_OVER (OpenAI prefers PRESENTED, and accepts HANDED_OVER if narrowly defined). |
| 5 | **Missing:** idempotency (a stable message id, dedup at store), a deadline with a named owner for every non-terminal state, and states for failure paths. |
| 6 | **Readiness comes from the runtime, not a sidecar guess.** v1: inject at a safe boundary, never mid-tool-call. |
| 7 | **Cadence:** event-driven on receipt, plus a periodic reconciliation sweep whose own heartbeat is monitored. |
| 8 | **Why designs stall:** the audit counts a mention as a build (OBS-575). Ratification must create the slice tasks, "built" must mean verified evidence, and a stalled ratified decision must escalate like an unanswered message. |
| 9 | **First slice is vertical,** between two real agent sessions, proven by a run-time nonce whose transformed value must come back in the reply; the receiving session is not told a message is coming; negative controls must fail (disable injection, kill the receiver, never-ready runtime). |

### Top risks, and they are one risk

- OpenAI: *counting a successful enqueue as consumption, recreating the silent failure behind more convincing receipts.*
- Z.ai: *the health machinery lying again — RECEIVED set, HANDED_OVER never arriving, while the ledger reads green.*
- Anthropic: *the design is ratified a second time and still not built, because the audit that treats "mentioned" as "built" is not fixed.*

All three are the same failure: **a proxy counted as the property.** That is the
pattern this session has found at every layer, from the P-011 gate to the push timeout
to the delegation regex, and now in both halves of consumption.

### Additions per reviewer, worth keeping

- **OpenAI — the runtime adapter is the decisive unspecified component.** HTTP push to a
  sidecar does not reach the agent. Something must insert content at a safe boundary,
  *wake an idle agent*, and record which model invocation received it. "A prompt queue
  can become another unread inbox."
- **OpenAI:** model the lifecycle as layers (delivery, presentation, disposition,
  response, monitoring) over an append-only event log, not one linear chain;
  at-least-once delivery with idempotent handling, never an exactly-once promise.
- **Z.ai:** *"internal states may fail a test but never pass one; only externally
  observable behaviour passes."* Add sender-side `UNDELIVERABLE`. `ESCALATED` is set by
  infrastructure on deadline, never by the party it exists to catch. If the hub stays as a
  fallback carrier, confirm semantics must be identical across carriers. Rename
  `INJECTED_NOW` to `HUB_ACCEPTED` or delete it.
- **Anthropic:** a `REJECTED`/quarantine state for messages that fail authentication; a
  first-contact sender stops at `RECEIVED` until a trust decision is made; a missed-tick
  alarm, so a dead tick is loud.

### F-6 — The runtime adapter already existed, and was broken (found while checking OpenAI's point)

The only runtime adapter today is the `UserPromptSubmit` hook
`agents/context/sidecar-inbox.sh` (T-3407). It fires only when a human types, so it
cannot wake an idle agent. **And since 2026-09-24 it surfaced nothing:** T-3442 wrapped
the producer's output as `{"consults": [...]}`, the hook still required a list, and it
exited 0 silently. The hook's own suite faked the producer with the old shape and stayed
green. That is why the 7 consults were never seen while the operator talked to the agent.
**Fixed and closed as T-3559**, with a contract test that runs the real producer into the
real hook (verified RED against the pre-fix hook).

So the answer to "why does consumption still not work" has two layers, both measured:
1. **Design:** D-645 was ratified and slice 1 was never built (OBS-575).
2. **Adapter:** the one adapter that did exist was silently broken for five days
   (T-3559, now fixed).

Waking an **idle** agent remains unsolved by any existing hook. The candidate already in
the system is TermLink's PTY injection into a TermLink-registered session, which is one
reason the Session Launch Policy requires `claude-fw --termlink`. This session is not
TermLink-registered, and so could not have been woken.
