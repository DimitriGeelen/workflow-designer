**Type:** script | **Subsystem:** framework-core | **Location:** `lib/verify_queue.py`

## What It Does

Lines we refuse to execute. CTL-013 already skips nested audit invocations
(L-391); scaling from 3 tasks to the whole queue widens the blast radius
enough that "skip and say so" beats "run and hope". Reported as SKIPPED, never
as PASS — a skip that reads as a pass is the vacuous-green class this rail
exists to remove.
