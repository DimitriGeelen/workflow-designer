# hook_absolute_paths

> Regression test — .claude/settings.json hook commands must emit absolute paths (canonicalized via cd && pwd at init/upgrade time), because Claude Code resolves hook commands against the session CWD. Relative paths cascade into tool-blocks when CWD drifts.

## What It Does

T-1364 (G-053-A): Unit tests for absolute hook paths in .claude/settings.json.
Claude Code resolves hook commands against the session CWD. When CWD drifts
(test fixtures, subdir navigation), relative paths like "bin/fw hook X"
cascade into tool-blocks. Fix: emit absolute paths at init/upgrade time.
$target_dir is canonicalized via `cd && pwd` in both entry points.
