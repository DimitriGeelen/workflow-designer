# hook_absolute_paths

> Regression test — .claude/settings.json hook commands must emit absolute paths (canonicalized via cd && pwd at init/upgrade time), because Claude Code resolves hook commands against the session CWD. Relative paths cascade into tool-blocks when CWD drifts.

**Type:** script | **Subsystem:** tests | **Location:** `tests/unit/hook_absolute_paths.bats`

**Tags:** `test`, `hooks`, `settings`, `G-053`, `T-1364`

## What It Does

T-1364 (G-053-A) / T-1504: hook commands in .claude/settings.json must resolve
INDEPENDENTLY OF CWD. Claude Code's hook runner (POSIX sh -c) does not chdir to the
project root, so a bare-relative command like "bin/fw hook X" only resolves when the
parent shell happens to be at project root — rarely true after any cd/subshell/
pipeline. Downstream 003-NTB-ATC-Plugin observed 680 silent failures in one session.
That regression is what this file guards, and it still does.
T-2709 (from the T-2704 RCA) — WHY THE ASSERTION CHANGED, and why this file was
rewritten rather than deleted:
The original remediation framed the choice as *relative vs absolute* and pinned the
winner as a test invariant here: every command must `startswith('/')`. But the
