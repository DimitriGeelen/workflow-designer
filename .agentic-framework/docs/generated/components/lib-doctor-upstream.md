**Type:** script | **Subsystem:** framework-core | **Location:** `lib/doctor-upstream.sh`

## What It Does

lib/doctor-upstream.sh — T-2843
Predicate for `fw doctor` check 2: is there a genuine ambiguity between the
framework a project is PINNED to (`upstream_repo:` in .framework.yaml) and the
framework it is actually RUNNING (`FRAMEWORK_ROOT`)?
The two fields answer different questions. `upstream_repo` names where updates
are pulled FROM; `FRAMEWORK_ROOT` names the copy currently executing. They
coincide only in shared-tooling mode, where a project is served by a framework
checkout living elsewhere on disk. Under D-377 (total isolation) the default is
vendored mode, where the running fw is the project's own `.agentic-framework/`
— so the two CANNOT be equal, and inequality carries no information.

| Component | Relationship | Description |
|-----------|--------------|-------------|
| [fw](/docs/generated/bin-fw) | called_by | Single entry point for all framework operations. Reads .framework.yaml from the project directory to resolve FRAMEWORK_ROOT, then routes commands to the appropriate agent. Supports both in-repo and shared tooling modes. |
