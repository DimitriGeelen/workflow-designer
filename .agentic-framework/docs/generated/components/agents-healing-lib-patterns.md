## What It Does

Healing Agent - patterns command
Show known failure patterns and mitigations

### Framework Reference

- **Parallel investigation / audit / enrichment:** 3-5 Task agents scan independent aspects; each writes findings to disk, returns path + summary. Cap at 5 parallel. Use `fw bus post` for formal tracking.
- **Sequential TDD:** Fresh agent per implementation task with review between.
- **TermLink parallel workers:** Spawn TermLink sessions for isolated heavy work. `termlink interact --json` for sync commands, `termlink pty inject/output` for interactive control. Cleanup with `termlink signal SIGTERM` + `termlink clean`. Preferred over Task agents when context isolation matters.
