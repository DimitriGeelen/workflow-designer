> Watchtower review blueprint: task review page — shows ACs, research artifacts, recommendation, approval actions.

**Type:** route | **Subsystem:** watchtower | **Location:** `web/blueprints/review.py`

## What It Does

T-1810: paused-dispatch helpers live in lib/ (CLI parity with `fw pause list`).

### Framework Reference

When agent ACs are complete and human ACs remain:

1. **Write your recommendation into the task file** — Add a `## Recommendation` section (Watchtower reads this) with:
   - **Recommendation:** GO / NO-GO / DEFER
   - **Rationale:** Why (cite evidence: what was fixed, what was proven, what remains)
   - **Evidence:** Bullet list of concrete proof (test results, file paths, metrics)
   You are the advisory. The human is the decision-maker. Never present a blank decision for them to fill in — always tell them what you recommend and why.
