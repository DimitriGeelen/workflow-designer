## What It Does

T-2737 — the watch file is the denominator of every fabric coverage check,
and nothing verified it fits the project `fw context init` stamped it into.
832 (rail-398) measured the untailored default on their tree: it expands to
ZERO files, so both coverage checks compared an empty set against the registry
and printed complete coverage. Their real population was 115 files, 15 carded
— 13%, reported as 100%. The reassuring "(15 cards)" was the card count being
read as a count of files checked.
Our shape differs: our watch file is tailored (this repo authored it) and
expands to 339 files. But 600+ cards point at files no pattern covers — the
registry has already decided those are components and the drift check cannot
