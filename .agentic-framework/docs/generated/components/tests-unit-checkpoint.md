# checkpoint

> TODO: describe what this component does

**Type:** script | **Subsystem:** unknown | **Location:** `tests/unit/checkpoint.bats`

## What It Does

Unit tests for agents/context/checkpoint.sh
Tests transcript discovery scoping (T-791) and status output

### Framework Reference

When fixing a bug discovered through real-world usage (user testing, production incident, cross-platform failure):
1. **Classify the bug** — Is this a new failure class, or a repeat of a known pattern?
2. **Check learnings.yaml** — Does a learning already exist for this class?
3. If new class: `fw context add-learning "description" --task T-XXX --source P-001`
4. If systemic (same class hit 2+ times): register in `concerns.yaml`, consider tooling fix (Level C/D)
