## What It Does

T-3056 — memory recall must see the OPEN task corpus, not only knowledge
harvested from closed work.
The three failure directions, all of which look like success from outside:
- not firing at all       -> the original bug, unchanged
- firing on itself        -> `fw context focus T-X` recalls T-X (A2)
- firing on everything    -> open tasks take every slot, learnings vanish (A3)
Fixtures use nonsense vocabulary so a hit cannot come from the real corpus.
