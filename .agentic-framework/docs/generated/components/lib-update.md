# update

> fw update subcommand: CLI wrapper for framework self-update. Pulls latest, runs upgrade, reports changes.

**Type:** script | **Subsystem:** framework-core | **Location:** `lib/update.sh`

## What It Does

fw update - Update the framework (vendored projects only)
Vendored projects (.agentic-framework/): clones upstream into temp dir,
re-vendors from there. Uses upstream_repo from .framework.yaml.
T-2854/D-377: the git-based global-install path (_do_update_git) was
dropped. It was only reachable via a global install (~/.agentic-framework
as a git clone), and T-2800 eliminated the producer of those — install.sh
now clones to a tempdir and deletes it. There is no global install left to
update in place.
