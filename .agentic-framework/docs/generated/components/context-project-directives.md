These are stable anchors — changes require human sovereignty approval

### Framework Reference

All architectural decisions must trace back to these directives:

1. **Antifragility** — System strengthens under stress; failures are learning events
2. **Reliability** — Predictable, observable, auditable execution; no silent failures
3. **Usability** — Joy to use/extend/debug; sensible defaults; actionable errors
4. **Portability** — No provider/language/environment lock-in; prefer standards (MCP, LSP, OpenAPI)
