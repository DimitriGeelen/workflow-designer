## What It Does

T-2457 / OBS-080: fabric card writes must be atomic.
Bug: both card writers truncated-then-streamed the destination card:
- register.sh:266  `cat > "$card_file" << EOF`
- enrich.py:34     `with open(path, "w") as f:`
A concurrent reader — notably `fw fabric drift` building its registered set
via `grep "^location:" "$COMPONENTS_DIR"/*.yaml` — could observe a card after
truncation but before the `location:` line was written. That card's source
path then dropped out of the registered set, so the file it points to was
reported "unregistered" — a spurious FP that cleared on immediate re-run once
the write completed (observed 2x during T-2440, which was actively
