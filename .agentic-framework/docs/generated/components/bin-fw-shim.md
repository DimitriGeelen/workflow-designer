# fw-shim

> Project-detecting fw shim: resolves framework root from .framework.yaml or bin/ location. Replaces global install symlink (T-664).

**Type:** script | **Subsystem:** framework-core | **Location:** `bin/fw-shim`

## What It Does

fw-shim — Project-detecting wrapper for the Agentic Engineering Framework CLI
This shim replaces the symlink to $HOME/.agentic-framework/bin/fw.
Instead of routing all `fw` calls to a global install, it walks up from
CWD to find the project-local fw and execs it.
Resolution order:
1. bin/fw          — framework repo (has FRAMEWORK.md at root)
2. .agentic-framework/bin/fw — consumer project (vendored framework)
Install: copy to ~/.local/bin/fw (or anywhere on PATH)
Origin: T-664 (Phase 2 of T-662: eliminate global install dependency)

| Component | Relationship | Description |
|-----------|--------------|-------------|
| [fw](/docs/generated/bin-fw) | calls | Single entry point for all framework operations. Reads .framework.yaml from the project directory to resolve FRAMEWORK_ROOT, then routes commands to the appropriate agent. Supports both in-repo and shared tooling modes. |
