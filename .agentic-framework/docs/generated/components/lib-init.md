fw init - Bootstrap a new project with the Agentic Engineering Framework
Creates the directory structure, config files, and git hooks needed
for a project to use the framework.

| Component | Relationship | Description |
|-----------|--------------|-------------|
| [git](/docs/generated/agents-git-git) | calls | Git Agent - Structural Enforcement for Git Operations |
| [validate-init](/docs/generated/lib-validate-init) | calls | Post-init validation — reads #@init: tags from init.sh and validates each creation unit exists and is correct. Called automatically at end of fw init and available as fw validate-init. |
| [preflight](/docs/generated/lib-preflight) | calls | fw preflight subcommand. Validates system prerequisites (bash version, git version, python3, PyYAML) before framework operations. |
| [context-dispatcher](/docs/generated/context-dispatcher) | calls | Central dispatcher for all context agent commands (init, focus, add-learning, add-pattern, add-decision, status, generate-episodic) |
| [fw](/docs/generated/bin-fw) | calls | Single entry point for all framework operations. Reads .framework.yaml from the project directory to resolve FRAMEWORK_ROOT, then routes commands to the appropriate agent. Supports both in-repo and shared tooling modes. |
| [git-identity](/docs/generated/lib-git-identity) | calls | TODO: describe what this component does |
