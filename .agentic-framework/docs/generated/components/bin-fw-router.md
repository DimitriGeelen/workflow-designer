## What It Does

fw-router — the `fw` entry point on PATH (T-2793, operator decision D-377).
This file contains NO framework logic and has NO version of its own. Its only
job is to answer one question — *which* fw should run here? — and hand over.
── Why this exists ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Before T-2793, `~/.local/bin/fw` was a symlink to a full 7,836-line framework
CLI. That CLI resolved FRAMEWORK_ROOT to the project's vendored copy and then
re-exec'd *itself* (`exec "$0" "$@"`), so a vendored consumer ran:
CLI dispatch  ← the global install   (whatever version that happens to be)
libs + agents ← the project's copy   (the version the project pinned)
Vendoring isolated libraries but not tooling. Every consumer ran an untested

| [router_no_global_fallback](/docs/generated/tests-unit-router_no_global_fallback) | called_by | Pins bin/fw-router's three post-T-2854 properties together (a fix that regressed any one would still pass a narrower test): refuses with no project found and no global consulted, still routes a vendored consumer project correctly, and still finds the project root walking up from a nested subdirectory. Also covers a residue global on the host not being routed to, and the framework repo itself still routing to its own bin/fw. |
