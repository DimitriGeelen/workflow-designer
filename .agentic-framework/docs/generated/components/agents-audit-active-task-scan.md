# active-task-scan

> Single-pass scan of active task files that checks compliance, quality, research artifacts, ownership, and review queue status in one efficient pass

**Type:** script | **Subsystem:** audit | **Location:** `agents/audit/active-task-scan.py`

## What It Does

T-3061: the unclosed-but-satisfied rule lives in lib/task_satisfaction.py — the
one definition, and the one with tests (tests/unit/test_task_satisfaction.py).
`parents[2]` is the framework root in both layouts: agents/audit/x.py in the
framework repo, and .agentic-framework/agents/audit/x.py in a vendored consumer.
