## What It Does

T-2735 — "which watched source files have no fabric card?" must have exactly
ONE answer in audit.sh, and it must be the canonical expander's.
T-1842 extracted expand_patterns.py as the single source of truth for the
glob + exclude predicate, after a parallel copy in register.sh / drift.sh
produced 5946 junk cards undetected for ~22 days. It migrated those two
callers. The two copies inside audit.sh were never migrated, so the surface
that reports a coverage verdict to the operator was the one still globbing
on its own.
The copy at :1405 had three independent zeroing defects (no PROJECT_ROOT
join, no recursive=True, no exclude) and reported through two pass() arms,
