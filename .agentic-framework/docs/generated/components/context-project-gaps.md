## What It Does

Gaps Register — Spec-Reality Gaps with Decision Triggers
Purpose: Structural memory for things we chose NOT to build yet.
Each gap has a trigger condition — when the trigger fires, we decide:
build the feature, or simplify the spec.
Checked by: audit agent (Section 8)
Surfaced in: handover documents
Status values:
watching         — gap identified, waiting for trigger
decided-build    — trigger fired, decided to build
decided-simplify — trigger fired, decided to simplify spec
