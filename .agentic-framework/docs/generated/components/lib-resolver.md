## What It Does

## Dependencies (7)

| Component | Relationship | Description |
|-----------|--------------|-------------|
| [patterns-data](/docs/generated/patterns-data) | calls | Stores failure, success, and workflow patterns discovered during project work. |
| [fw](/docs/generated/bin-fw) | calls | Single entry point for all framework operations. Reads .framework.yaml from the project directory to resolve FRAMEWORK_ROOT, then routes commands to the appropriate agent. Supports both in-repo and shared tooling modes. |
| [spawn](/docs/generated/lib-spawn) | calls | TODO: describe what this component does |
| [bvp](/docs/generated/lib-bvp) | calls | TODO: describe what this component does |
| [keylock-py](/docs/generated/lib-keylock-py) | uses | Python sibling of lib/keylock.sh: sidecar fcntl.flock advisory locks in .context/locks/, with a bounded timeout that raises loudly rather than degrading to a silent skipped write. Guards the dispatch ledger against the concurrent-append erasure fixed in T-3042. |
| [spawn](/docs/generated/lib-spawn) | uses | TODO: describe what this component does |
| [worker_identity](/docs/generated/lib-worker_identity) | uses | TODO: describe what this component does |
