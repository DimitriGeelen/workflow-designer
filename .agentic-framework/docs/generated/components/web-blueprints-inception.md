1. **State the phase** — Say "This is an inception/exploration task" before doing any work
2. **Present the filled template** for review before executing any spikes or prototypes
3. **Do not write build artifacts** (production code, full apps) before `fw inception decide T-XXX go`
4. **The commit-msg hook enforces this** — after 2 exploration commits, further commits are blocked until a decision is recorded
5. After a GO decision, **create separate build tasks** for implementation — do not continue building under the inception task ID
6. **R
