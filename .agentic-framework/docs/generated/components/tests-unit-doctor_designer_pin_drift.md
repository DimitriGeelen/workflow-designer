# doctor_designer_pin_drift

> TODO: describe what this component does

**Type:** script | **Subsystem:** unknown | **Location:** `tests/unit/doctor_designer_pin_drift.bats`

## What It Does

T-2524 (T-2521 integration hardening): fw doctor content-compares (sha256, never
mtime) the vendored Workflow Designer build against policy/designer-pin.yaml.
Sibling of the MCP manifest + cron registry→generated drift checks.
Surface under test: bin/fw doctor designer-pin block.
States:
vendored sha256 == pin sha256           → OK    — t1
vendored sha256 != pin sha256           → WARN  — t2
vendored file absent (per pin path)     → WARN  — t3 (was SKIP until T-3064)
pin present but missing sha256/path     → SKIP  — t4
HERMETIC (T-2547): the pin drift check honors FW_DESIGNER_PIN_FILE. Each test points
