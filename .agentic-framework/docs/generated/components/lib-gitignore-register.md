## What It Does

T-2994 (build slice of T-2992) — .gitignore rules that defer without a register.
THE ASYMMETRY THIS EXISTS FOR. Every suppression mechanism the framework uses
announces itself when it fires, except one:
skip "reason"      prints its reason on every suite run
allowlist entry    echoed by whichever scanner consults it
.gitignore rule    emits nothing, ever
A gitignore rule is the only one that removes a signal silently AND
permanently. There is no run, no report, and no moment at which it says "I am
suppressing something".
That is not a general worry, it is a measured incident. T-2990: two rules
