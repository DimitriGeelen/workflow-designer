## What It Does

integrate-go-live.sh — safe zone-3 host go-live (T-2483; OBS-086).
Make MAIN's running framework code match a remote ref (default origin/master)
WITHOUT merging two divergent busy checkouts.
Going live = MAIN's CODE (lib/ agents/ bin/) matches master. The DATA
(.context/*) must stay MAIN's — it carries accumulators (feedback-stream,
gate-bypass-log, decisions, inbox, metrics-history) that diverge legitimately
per host and must never be clobbered. So we do a surgical code-only sync:
git checkout <remote-ref> -- <code dirs>   # bring master's code, only code
git commit -m "T-XXX: ..."                 # commit only the staged code
This touches ZERO .context/ data, so it cannot conflict on accumulators and
