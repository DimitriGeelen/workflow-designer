## What It Does

T-2338 (arc-011 M1 §2) — harness yield-point spike.
Single-host cooperative-poll mechanism. The orchestrator writes a flag file
at .context/working/.dispatch-flag with content like:
refuse-write:/abs/path/that/conflicts
Workers invoke `yield-point.sh check <target_path>` before each Write/Edit.
If the flag is present AND its content matches the target path, the script
prints a refusal on stderr and exits non-zero — the worker treats the
non-zero exit as "do not write".
Design properties:
- Pure file polling, zero IPC dependency. Works on single host without
