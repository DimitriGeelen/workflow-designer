## What It Does

lib/arc.sh — Arc system (T-1653 Phase 1 / T-1661 / T-1848)
Arcs are first-class workspaces grouping tasks by theme. Two identities:
• slug  — human-readable filename stem (e.g., `orchestrator-rethink`).
Used in URLs, tags (arc:<slug>), and discussion. Stable but
not immutable — a slug may be renamed (rare; never auto).
• arc-NNN — immutable sequential numeric ID (e.g., `arc-001`) written
into the YAML's `id:` field at creation time. Never renumbered,
never reused, never deleted (status flips, file stays).
D-Immutability axiom (T-1846 inception §11.3, captured here so future
changes find it):

### Framework Reference

Enforced structurally. `fw arc create` requires `--headline-mechanic "<who> <does what> <observes what user-visible result>"` and rejects substrate-only phrasing. `fw arc close` requires `--demo <path|url|none>` — a wire-level artefact (meta.json, stream-json, screencast, live URL) traceable to the arc, or `none` with a `--justification` logged to `.context/audits/arc-bypass.jsonl`. The gates fire before any closure narrative; substrate-vs-deliverable conflation cannot bypass them.

## Dependencies (4)

| Component | Relationship | Description |
|-----------|--------------|-------------|
| [update-task](/docs/generated/agents-task-create-update-task) | calls | Task Update Agent - Status transitions with auto-triggers |
| [arc_membership-sh](/docs/generated/lib-arc_membership-sh) | calls | Canonical shell helper for arc-membership scans (T-1880 / T-NEW-15). Consolidates the union-of-`arc_id:`-frontmatter + legacy `arc:<slug>`-tag scan that previously lived inline in three shell consumers: lib/arc.sh, agents/handover/handover.sh, lib/evolution_log.sh. Companion to lib/arc_membership.py (which serves the Python/Flask side).  Public API (PROJECT_ROOT must be set):   arc_tasks_with_arc_id <slug>   → T-IDs whose `arc_id:` matches slug   arc_tasks_with_tag <tag>       → T-IDs whose `tags:` includes tag  Origin: silent-corpus #1 (T-1874/75/76/77) and #2 (T-1879) — captured as L-397. Each inline consumer had to be migrated independently after the T-1850 tags-to-arc_id storage migration; consolidation prevents the next storage-format migration from leaking through nine sites again. |
| [watchtower](/docs/generated/lib-watchtower) | calls | Detects the running Watchtower instance URL and provides browser-open helpers for scripts that need to link to the web UI |
| [fw](/docs/generated/bin-fw) | calls | Single entry point for all framework operations. Reads .framework.yaml from the project directory to resolve FRAMEWORK_ROOT, then routes commands to the appropriate agent. Supports both in-repo and shared tooling modes. |
