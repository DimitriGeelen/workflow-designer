## What It Does

T-1843 / T-1829 — pre-push monotonicity gate, ancestor refinement.
Origin: T-1828 (2nd incident of T-1602 class). The T-1603 hook used
`sort -V` only; that proxy conflated "remote is older commit with higher
VERSION (tag-counter reset)" with "HEAD reset to older commit (real
rollback)". T-1829 inception decided GO Candidate C: when local-VERSION
sort-V-lower than remote, check ancestor relation; if remote sha is an
ancestor of local sha, the push is genuinely forward in commit time —
allow. Otherwise (or if remote sha not locally known) fall back to the
strict-block behaviour T-1602 motivated.
