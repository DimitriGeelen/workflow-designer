# continuous-mode

> TODO: describe what this component does

**Type:** script | **Subsystem:** framework-core | **Location:** `lib/continuous-mode.sh`

## What It Does

Continuous-run counters (T-3169, arc-012 S3).
`.continuous-mode.yaml` carries TWO ceilings, counted in different units:
current_iteration / max_iterations  — SESSIONS. Advanced by SessionStart
(agents/context/inject-next-directive.py). Bounds how many context
windows one run may consume.
tasks_completed   / max_tasks       — TASKS. Advanced here, on the
work-completed transition. Bounds how much WORK one run may do.
They are not interchangeable and neither substitutes for the other. Before
T-3164 the two were the same number by accident, because a session could only
take one turn and the run advanced a window per unit of work; `max_iterations: 5`
