## What It Does

Helpers

### Framework Reference

When you need to propose a new free driver, an arc-scoped driver, or sharpen an existing one, the canonical workflow lives in **`policy/prompts/`** — NOT inlined into this CLAUDE.md.

| Bundle file | When to reach for it |
|-------------|----------------------|
| `policy/prompts/bvp-driver-session.md` | **Always start here.** Keystone. Three workflows (A=batch-propose, B=discover+sharpen, C=sharpen named topic). Entry/exit conditions, outputs, init refusal, degraded mode. |
| `policy/prompts/artefact-template.md` | When writing the research artefact (`docs/reports/T-XXXX-bvp-driver-*.md`). YAM
