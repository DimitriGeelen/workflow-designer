## What It Does

T-1839 — fw upgrade silent-downgrade guard.
Origin: T-1838 (sibling) fixed the doctor advice that would have pointed
operators at a downgrading `fw upgrade`. T-1839 closes the loop by making
the command itself refuse the downgrade direction unless explicitly
overridden with --force-downgrade.
Pre-fix behaviour (lib/upgrade.sh:1082-1112): direction-blind overwrite of
.framework.yaml's `version:` field with $FW_VERSION whenever the two
differ. Consumer at 1.6.260 + framework at 1.6.170 → silent downgrade,
only post-facto forensic trail in `upgraded_from` + audit YAML.
These tests pin:
