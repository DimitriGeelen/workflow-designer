## What It Does

T-1945 — Heredoc-in-command-substitution edit-time guard.
PreToolUse hook on Write/Edit. When the agent proposes editing
bin/fw and the proposed content/new_string contains an inline
`$(... <<TAG ... TAG)` block (or `python3 - <<TAG`), emit a one-line
stderr warning naming L-332 and L-408 with the canonical fix.
Advisory only — exit 0. The class is a self-lockout failure mode but
not every heredoc-in-cmd-sub is dangerous (the stable multi-line-clean
`<<PYEOF\n...\nPYEOF\n)` shape works fine). Blocking would obstruct
legitimate maintenance edits to an existing heredoc.
Exit codes:
