# task_id_race

> Regression test — concurrent fw work-on invocations must allocate distinct task IDs. Prior bug: generate_id() read max_id then (later) wrote the file; N parallel invocations all observed the same max_id and wrote T-${max+1}. Fix: keylock around read-compute-write sequence.

## What It Does

T-1279: Concurrent fw work-on must allocate distinct task IDs.
Prior bug: generate_id() read max_id, then (later) wrote the file. N parallel
invocations all observed the same max_id and all wrote T-${max+1}.
Fix: keylock around the read-compute-write sequence.
