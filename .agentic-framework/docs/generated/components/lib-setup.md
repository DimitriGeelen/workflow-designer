## What It Does

fw setup - Guided onboarding wizard for new projects
A 6-step breadcrumb flow that wraps fw init with guided configuration.
Each step is idempotent (sentinel-checked) and safe to re-run.
Steps:
1. Project Identity    — name, description, owner
2. Provider Selection  — claude, cursor, generic
3. Tech Stack          — languages, test framework, conventions
4. Enforcement Level   — strict, standard, advisory
5. First Task          — optional initial task creation
6. Verification        — fw doctor + cheat sheet
