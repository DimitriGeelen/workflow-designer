## What It Does

claude-fw — Claude Code wrapper with auto-restart support
Runs claude normally, then checks for a restart signal file
written by checkpoint.sh when auto-handover fires at critical budget.
If found (and fresh), auto-restarts with `claude -c` to continue.
Usage:
claude-fw [claude-args...]          # Run with auto-restart enabled
claude-fw --no-restart [args...]    # Run without auto-restart
claude-fw --termlink [args...]      # Register as TermLink session for remote access
TL_CLAUDE_ENABLED=1 claude-fw      # Same via env var
The restart signal file is .context/working/.restart-requested
