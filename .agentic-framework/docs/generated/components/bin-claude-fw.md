## What It Does

claude-fw — Claude Code wrapper with auto-restart support
Runs claude normally, then checks for a restart signal file
written by checkpoint.sh when auto-handover fires at critical budget.
If found (and fresh), auto-restarts with `claude -c` to continue.
Usage:
claude-fw [claude-args...]          # Run with auto-restart enabled
claude-fw --no-restart [args...]    # Run without auto-restart
claude-fw --termlink [args...]      # Register as TermLink session for remote access
TL_CLAUDE_ENABLED=1 claude-fw      # Same via env var
The restart signal file is .context/working/.restart-requested

## Dependencies (1)

| Component | Relationship | Description |
|-----------|--------------|-------------|
| [checkpoint](/docs/generated/checkpoint) | reads | Post-tool budget monitoring. Warns at thresholds, auto-triggers handover at critical, detects compaction, manages inception checkpoints. — _Reads .context/working/.restart-requested signal file written by checkpoint.sh_ |

## Used By (2)

| Component | Relationship | Description |
|-----------|--------------|-------------|
| [claude-fw-router](/docs/generated/bin-claude-fw-router) | triggers_by | The `claude-fw` entry point installed onto PATH. Walks up from cwd to find the current project (framework repo or vendored consumer, same predicate as bin/fw-router) and execs THAT project's own bin/claude-fw. Replaces a fixed copy of the wrapper's logic that install.sh used to put on PATH — a fixed copy runs the same bytes regardless of which project you're standing in, which is the global-install problem wearing a different name (T-2854). Falls back to plain `claude` when no project is found or the resolved project has no claude-fw sibling. |
| [t3213_start_event_confirmation](/docs/generated/tests-unit-t3213_start_event_confirmation) | tests_by | End-to-end confirmation suite for the claude-fw start-event ledger: runs the real bin/claude-fw in a scratch git repo with a stubbed claude binary and asserts the start event is written, is idempotent, and degrades correctly when the ledger path is unwritable. |
