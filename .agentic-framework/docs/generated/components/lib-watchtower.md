# watchtower

> Detects the running Watchtower instance URL and provides browser-open helpers for scripts that need to link to the web UI

**Type:** script | **Subsystem:** framework-core | **Location:** `lib/watchtower.sh`

## What It Does

lib/watchtower.sh — Shared Watchtower URL detection and browser-open helper (T-974, T-1154)
Centralizes port detection, host detection, and browser opening so that
ALL scripts use the same logic. Eliminates hardcoded ports and duplicated
browser-open code.
Usage:
source "$FRAMEWORK_ROOT/lib/watchtower.sh"
url=$(_watchtower_url T-XXX)                    # get base URL with correct port
_watchtower_open "http://host:port/path"         # open in browser (desktop-user aware)
Requires: PROJECT_ROOT (from paths.sh chain), config.sh for fw_config

### Framework Reference

**Watchtower's port is per-project, not hard-coded to `3000`.** Two consumer projects on one host would collide if the framework assumed 3000 everywhere.

Resolution order (T-885, T-1287, T-1376):

1. **`.context/working/watchtower.url`** — triple-file source of truth, written by `bin/watchtower.sh` on start. Read this file, don't guess.
2. **`bin/fw config get PORT`** — per-project `FW_PORT` config when no Watchtower is currently running.
3. **`3000`** — default ONLY when neither of the above is available (fresh project, no config, no running instance).
