# check-settings-edit

> PostToolUse hook (Write|Edit matcher) that fires an advisory L-398 reminder
when .claude/settings.json is written/edited. Reminds the agent to add
`bin/fw enforcement baseline` to the active task's Verification block so
the canonical hash refreshes at task-close. Strictly advisory (exit 0).

Origin: T-1886 RCA Candidate B — paired with T-1887 Candidate A (template
hint). The enforcement-baseline-drift class accumulated for multiple
sessions across T-1849/T-1730/T-1731 before T-1886 cleaned up.

## What It Does

Enforcement-baseline refresh nudge — PostToolUse hook for Write|Edit on .claude/settings.json
When the agent edits .claude/settings.json (adding/removing/reorganising hooks), emits an
advisory reminder to add `bin/fw enforcement baseline` to the active task's Verification
block. Otherwise the canonical hash diverges and `fw doctor` reports FAIL.
Exit code: always 0 (advisory only, never blocks).
Output: JSON with additionalContext when reminder needed; nothing otherwise.
Origin: T-1886 RCA Candidate B — deployed after T-1887 Candidate A (template hint).
Pairs with L-398. See also: T-1849, T-1730, T-1731 (the hook-additions that originally
left the baseline in FAIL across multiple sessions).
