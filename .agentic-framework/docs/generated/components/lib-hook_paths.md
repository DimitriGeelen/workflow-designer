## What It Does

## Dependencies (2)

| Component | Relationship | Description |
|-----------|--------------|-------------|
| [paths](/docs/generated/lib-paths) | calls | Centralized path resolution for the framework. Sets FRAMEWORK_ROOT, PROJECT_ROOT, TASKS_DIR, CONTEXT_DIR. Replaces the 3-line SCRIPT_DIR/FRAMEWORK_ROOT/PROJECT_ROOT pattern previously duplicated across 25+ agent scripts. Also sources lib/compat.sh for cross-platform helpers. |
| [fw](/docs/generated/bin-fw) | calls | Single entry point for all framework operations. Reads .framework.yaml from the project directory to resolve FRAMEWORK_ROOT, then routes commands to the appropriate agent. Supports both in-repo and shared tooling modes. |

Fires only on genuine file creation; git-mv completion path never reaches it. Blocks under agent control; override FW_ALLOW_ACTIVE_COMPLETED_DUP=1 (Tier-2 logged). |
