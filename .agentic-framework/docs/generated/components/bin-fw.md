# fw

> Single entry point for all framework operations. Reads .framework.yaml from the project directory to resolve FRAMEWORK_ROOT, then routes commands to the appropriate agent. Supports both in-repo and shared tooling modes.

**Type:** script | **Subsystem:** framework-core | **Location:** `bin/fw`

## What It Does

fw - Agentic Engineering Framework CLI
Single entry point for all framework operations.
Reads .framework.yaml from the project directory to resolve
FRAMEWORK_ROOT, then routes commands to the appropriate agent.
When run from a project that uses the framework as shared tooling,
fw reads .framework.yaml to find the framework install path.
When run from inside the framework repo itself, it auto-detects.

### Framework Reference

`fw` is the single entry point for all framework operations — it resolves paths, sets env vars, and routes to agents. Discover commands via `fw help`, `fw <cmd> --help`, or the Quick Reference section below.

**Path resolution:** `fw` finds the framework via `bin/fw`'s location (inside framework repo) or via `.framework.yaml` in the project root (shared tooling mode).

Reads sub-agent transcript from payload.transcript_path, appends telemetry line to .context/working/subagent-returns.jsonl, and if bytes > THRESHOLD posts the full message to fw bus as a blob so later turns can read via R-NNN without re-ingesting. Exits 0 always (capture-and-log, not interceptor). |

| [check_active_task_switch_focus](/docs/generated/tests-unit-check_active_task_switch_focus) | tests_by | Pins the focus-drift bypass mechanism contract introduced by T-1730 and fixed by T-1890. The check-active-task.sh PreToolUse hook blocks under CLAUDECODE=1 when a Bash command targets a task ≠ focused task. Two bypass mechanisms exist:   (a) --switch-focus flag — for fw commands whose downstream parsers       (update-task.sh, lib/{learning,pattern,decision}.sh) consume it       as a no-op token.   (b) FW_SWITCH_FOCUS=1 env-var prefix — universal, works for `git       commit ... T-X: ...` where git rejects unknown flags.  Origin: T-1890 — last-session closures of T-1854/T-1855 hit "Unknown option: --switch-focus" from update-task.sh; agent worked around via direct-invoke `bash agents/task-create/update-task.sh` which the hook regex doesn't match → silent bypass, no audit trail. Producer/consumer split: hook shipped the contract; consumers never honoured it.  9 tests: block-without-bypass, --switch-focus flag allow+log, FW_SWITCH_FOCUS=1 allow+log, FW_SWITCH_FOCUS=1 unlocks git commit case, block-message names both mechanisms, four downstream consumers each accept --switch-focus without Unknown-option exit. |

Reminds the agent to add `bin/fw enforcement baseline` to the active task's Verification block so the canonical hash refreshes at task-close. Strictly advisory (exit 0).  Origin: T-1886 RCA Candidate B — paired with T-1887 Candidate A (template hint). The enforcement-baseline-drift class accumulated for multiple sessions across T-1849/T-1730/T-1731 before T-1886 cleaned up. |

Half the legs are false-positive controls: a detector that reddens legitimate optional-dependency skips gets suppressed wholesale, so the legs asserting it stays quiet are the ones that decide whether it survives. Includes the mutation control and the two heredoc-blindness regressions found by reconciling the census against a naive grep. |
| [t3213_start_event_confirmation](/docs/generated/tests-unit-t3213_start_event_confirmation) | tests_by | End-to-end confirmation suite for the claude-fw start-event ledger: runs the real bin/claude-fw in a scratch git repo with a stubbed claude binary and asserts the start event is written, is idempotent, and degrades correctly when the ledger path is unwritable. |
| [t3221_commit_exemption_clause](/docs/generated/tests-unit-t3221_commit_exemption_clause) | tests_by | Pins the commit-checkpoint exemption in the Bash task gate. Both exemption branches (T-2054 null-focus, T-3179 partial-complete) once admitted any command whose raw text CONTAINED "git commit" — so a trailing `; rm -rf` rode through, a `\| tee` write the gate had already flagged was admitted anyway, and an unknown binary passed because a quoted argument said the words. This suite probes the SHIPPED hook through its real stdin JSON contract rather than re-implementing the predicate, and carries two controls that decide whether a green run means anything: a mutation control that rebuilds the pre-fix hook from live source (so reverting the fix reddens the suite), and a 16-command no-widening sweep asserting the fixed hook admits nothing the pre-fix one blocked. |
| [t3222_fetch_writes_file](/docs/generated/tests-unit-t3222_fetch_writes_file) | tests_by | Pins that curl and wget are admitted by the Bash safe-list only when they do not write a file. Both sat in the list unconditionally, so `curl -o FILE` and `wget -O FILE` — which write with no shell redirect, and are therefore invisible to has_bash_write_pattern — ran with no active task. Covers 22 spellings in both directions, including the stdout forms (`-o -`, `-O -`) that must stay safe and the framework's own documented verification idiom `curl -sf "$(bin/fw watchtower url)/page"`. Two legs carry the design decision: one asserts a commit whose MESSAGE mentions `curl -o` is still admitted (why the check is clause-scoped rather than in the whole-string write scanner), and one asserts a commit chained to a fetch-write is now refused with no change to the T-3221 commit predicate. Mutation control restores the unconditional arm from live source; a no-widening sweep asserts the fix admits nothing the pre-fix version blocked. |

| [t3235_archived_horizon_invariant](/docs/generated/tests-unit-t3235_archived_horizon_invariant) | tests_by | Pins that a task file under .tasks/completed/ carries horizon: null whichever branch archived it. Two branches move a task there and their entry conditions are exact complements, so the null-ing written at the first site (T-2163, widened T-2300 after eight CTL-030 instances) could never reach the partial-complete recheck branch. The sharp end is fw task archive-eligible, which re-invokes --status work-completed and therefore drives exclusively through the branch that was unfixed. Every leg asserts WHICH branch ran before asserting the outcome, because the obvious fixture leaves status started-work and never enters the recheck branch at all — a rig that checks only the outcome goes green against the wrong path. A control pins the deliberate case the fix must NOT break: a partial-complete that stays in active/ keeps its stored horizon, which is why the post-condition keys on location, not status. The mutation control removes the post-condition from a live-derived copy and needs a symlink farm, since update-task.sh derives FRAMEWORK_ROOT from its own location and a dead subject reads exactly like a regressed one. Reported by peer 832-Workflow-designer (their T-654 BUG 1); confirmed in-tree first. |
