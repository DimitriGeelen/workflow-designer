> Task Update Agent - Status transitions with auto-triggers

**Type:** script | **Subsystem:** task-management | **Location:** `agents/task-create/update-task.sh`

## What It Does

Task Update Agent - Status transitions with auto-triggers
Updates task frontmatter and triggers structural actions:
issues/blocked  → auto-diagnose via healing agent
work-completed  → set date_finished, move to completed/, generate episodic
Usage:
./agents/task-create/update-task.sh T-XXX --status issues
./agents/task-create/update-task.sh T-XXX --status work-completed
./agents/task-create/update-task.sh T-XXX --owner claude-code
./agents/task-create/update-task.sh T-XXX --status blocked --reason "Waiting on API key"

The check-active-task.sh PreToolUse hook blocks under CLAUDECODE=1 when a Bash command targets a task ≠ focused task. Two bypass mechanisms exist:   (a) --switch-focus flag — for fw commands whose downstream parsers       (update-task.sh, lib/{learning,pattern,decision}.sh) consume it       as a no-op token.   (b) FW_SWITCH_FOCUS=1 env-var prefix — universal, works for `git       commit ... T-X: ...` where git rejects unknown flags.  Origin: T-1890 — last-session closures of T-1854/T-1855 hit "Unknown option: --switch-focus" from update-task.sh; agent worked around via direct-invoke `bash agents/task-create/update-task.sh` which the hook regex doesn't match → silent bypass, no audit trail. Producer/consumer split: hook shipped the contract; consumers never honoured it.  9 tests: block-without-bypass, --switch-focus flag allow+log, FW_SWITCH_FOCUS=1 allow+log, FW_SWITCH_FOCUS=1 unlocks git commit case, block-message names both mechanisms, four downstream consumers each accept --switch-focus without Unknown-option exit. |

| [t3235_archived_horizon_invariant](/docs/generated/tests-unit-t3235_archived_horizon_invariant) | tests_by | Pins that a task file under .tasks/completed/ carries horizon: null whichever branch archived it. Two branches move a task there and their entry conditions are exact complements, so the null-ing written at the first site (T-2163, widened T-2300 after eight CTL-030 instances) could never reach the partial-complete recheck branch. The sharp end is fw task archive-eligible, which re-invokes --status work-completed and therefore drives exclusively through the branch that was unfixed. Every leg asserts WHICH branch ran before asserting the outcome, because the obvious fixture leaves status started-work and never enters the recheck branch at all — a rig that checks only the outcome goes green against the wrong path. A control pins the deliberate case the fix must NOT break: a partial-complete that stays in active/ keeps its stored horizon, which is why the post-condition keys on location, not status. The mutation control removes the post-condition from a live-derived copy and needs a symlink farm, since update-task.sh derives FRAMEWORK_ROOT from its own location and a dead subject reads exactly like a regressed one. Reported by peer 832-Workflow-designer (their T-654 BUG 1); confirmed in-tree first. |
| [t3219_verification_count_reconciliation](/docs/generated/tests-unit-t3219_verification_count_reconciliation) | tests_by | Pins the P-011 verification gate against unreconciled counts: a stdin-reading verification command must not swallow the rest of the block, and pass+fail must equal total or the close is refused. Runs mutated copies of update-task.sh from a symlink farm because FRAMEWORK_ROOT is derived from script location. |
| [t3220_verification_gate_exits](/docs/generated/tests-unit-t3220_verification_gate_exits) | tests_by | Pins that every failure path in run_verification_commands exits rather than returns, and that the choice does not depend on set -euo pipefail 1700 lines away. Four measured cells (exit/return x errexit present/absent) isolate the dependency; the two control cells stop the suite passing against anything. |
| [t3235_archived_horizon_invariant](/docs/generated/tests-unit-t3235_archived_horizon_invariant) | called_by | Pins that a task file under .tasks/completed/ carries horizon: null whichever branch archived it.
