# consumer-recover

> TODO: describe what this component does

**Type:** script | **Subsystem:** framework-core | **Location:** `lib/consumer-recover.sh`

## What It Does

fw consumer-recover - one-command recovery for legacy vendored consumers
Wraps the 4-step recipe documented in feedback_t2232_forward_looking_recovery
(SSH to host, clone upstream, env-scoped fw upgrade, cleanup) behind a single
verb. Dry-run by default — operator must pass --apply to execute.
Authorised under T-2233 GO (2026-06-07). Full design spec:
docs/reports/T-2233-consumer-recover-design.md
Exit codes:
0   dry-run printed OR --apply succeeded
1   precondition failed (unreachable / missing tooling / project not found)
2   consumer is post-T-2232 — refused with redirect to plain fw upgrade
