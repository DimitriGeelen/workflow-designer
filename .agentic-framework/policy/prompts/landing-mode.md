# Landing Mode — the "stop finding, start landing" prompt (v5)

**Status:** operator-issued directive, codified T-3201, revised T-3205, T-3229.
v1 lived only in chat and had to be reconstructed from scratch when the operator
asked a second time. This file is the durable copy — paste §The Prompt, or say
"run landing mode".

**Origin:** the operator's own words, three times now: *"stop finding, start
landing … and push it all the way through to success."* Those two phrases are
theirs. **Everything else in this file, §The Prompt included, is agent-authored**
— do not quote it back to the operator as their instruction.

**Revision history.** Each version is what a run measured, not what someone
thought would be better:

| ver | run that produced it | what it learned |
|---|---|---|
| v1 | first run | landed 3, **filed 6** — the directive was violated by the agent's own filing rate |
| v2 | T-3201 | added the filing budget, the mutation rule, the flag-exists rule, the bypass rule |
| v3 | T-3205 | one of v2's two stated premises was **false and costly**; added the premise-collapse rule |
| v4 | T-3218 | the **verification rule itself produced a false green** — "curl for a 200" names the wrong number |
| v5 | T-3229 | premise 1 had **inverted two runs earlier** and nobody re-checked it; the quadrant it called dead returns 23 rows — but its cost axis is a 0.1 tie-break, so it is a pool and not a queue |

---

## What v3 changes

**A premise section is a liability if nobody re-checks it.** v2 carried two
premises "that do not currently hold", with the instruction to delete them when
they changed. Neither had been re-measured between runs. On the third run both
were checked; one had inverted, and it had been *actively steering the agent
wrong* — see below. That is the failure this revision exists to prevent, and it
is why every premise below now carries the date and command it was checked with.

The v2 run also produced one rule by counter-example: it landed 2 tasks and filed
1, comfortably inside the filing budget — but one of those landings was filed on a
premise that collapsed under checking. The budget governs *how much* you file; it
said nothing about *what to do when the thing you are landing turns out not to be
real*. §The Prompt now does.

## Premises — premise 1 re-measured 2026-08-31, fifth run

Check these yourself at the start of a run. Do not inherit them.

1. **"check hv/hc & hv/lc tasks"** — **NOT DEAD. IT INVERTED, AND FOR TWO RUNS
   NOBODY LOOKED.** Re-measured 2026-08-31 with
   `bin/fw bvp --quadrant hv-hc --include-proposed` (and the same for `hv-lc`):
   **7 rows and 16 rows.**

   v3's quote is verbatim and *still reproduces today* — the bare
   `fw bvp --quadrant hv-hc` does print *"No tasks have `bvp_scores:` set yet"*.
   What v3 missed is that the refusal **names its own escape three lines down**:
   *"Or pass `--include-proposed` to see estimator-proposed scores (advisory)."*
   The premise was measured by reading the first line of a refusal and stopping
   there. `fw bvp confirm` is still a sovereignty boundary (T-1924) and confirmed
   scores still do not exist; the estimator's *proposed* scores are what the flag
   surfaces, and they are advisory by construction.

   **But do not read the quadrant as a priority order.** Measured the same day,
   over the 27 tasks that have a cost at all:

   | value | cost | quadrant | n |
   |---|---|---|---|
   | 108 | 3.7–3.8 | hv-hc | 7 |
   | 108 | 3.6 | hv-lc | 15 |
   | 64 | 3.2 | hv-lc | 1 |
   | 12–18 | 1.9–4.6 | lv-* | 4 |

   The **value** axis discriminates: 23 high against 4 low, 108/64 versus 12–18,
   a real gap worth acting on. The **cost** axis inside the high-value band does
   not — 22 of those 23 rows carry *identical* value 108 and are separated only
   by 3.6 against 3.7, one tick of the F8 composite. So "try hv-hc, then hv-lc"
   reads as a ranking and is not one; it is a tie-break on rounding.

   And `fw bvp` prints the larger caveat itself: **145 of 172 tasks (84%) have no
   cost at all**, so the quadrant is computed over 16% of the corpus and is silent
   about the rest. Cost becomes measurable only once `components:` resolves, which
   happens at the `work-completed` transition — the very tasks you are selecting
   *among* are the ones structurally least likely to have one (T-3068; L-624: a
   cost axis must distinguish *unmeasured* from *zero*).

   **The rule:** pass `--include-proposed`, then treat hv-hc ∪ hv-lc as a
   **candidate pool, not a queue** — say what fraction of the corpus it came from,
   and intersect it with the arc. The lv-* exclusion is real signal; the hc/lc
   split is not. If the pool is empty or none of it touches the arc, **fall back
   to selecting by arc** and say plainly that you are doing so.

2. ~~"There is nobody to talk to on the chat arc."~~ **DELETED — this was false,
   and believing it would have cost the run.** Measured on the third run:
   `termlink agent unread` returned **7 unread**, and offset 689 was a
   substantive three-part message addressed to this project, carrying a
   generalised defect class (*a guard that reimplements the code it guards cannot
   detect that code being fixed*). That finding directly shaped the mutation step
   of the task landed that run, which then caught two tests that asserted nothing.

   The replacement rule: **read the inbox first, every run, before selection.**
   Peers on this arc send real findings, in both directions, and they arrive
   asynchronously — the cost of checking is one command, the cost of skipping is
   a finding you never see. v2's phrasing ("report the absence rather than
   manufacturing chatter") was right about not manufacturing chatter and wrong
   about the absence; keep the first half, drop the second.

## What v4 changes

**v3's own verification rule produced a false green, on the run that wrote v4.**
That is the strongest possible reason to change it: the rule was followed exactly
and still passed five links to another project's page.

Measured 2026-08-29, reproduced deterministically:

    curl -s -o /tmp/.pg -w '%{http_code}' "$W/review/T-100201"  -> prints 200
    echo $?                                                     -> 23  (CURLE_WRITE_ERROR)
    ls -la /tmp/.pg  ->  dimitri-mint-dev  87500B  Aug 27   (project 1023's page)

`/tmp/.pg` was a foreign file this process could not overwrite. curl reported the
**transfer's** status — which really was 200 — while writing nothing, so the byte
count, the title and the grep all came from a stale page belonging to a different
project. Five approval links "verified", and the 404 control "verified" too, at
byte-identical size. The tell was that *everything* was identical, including the
control; had the foreign file happened to be a plausible page, nothing would have
looked wrong at all.

**The framework's documented idiom was never affected** and does not need changing:
`curl -sf "$(bin/fw watchtower url)/page" -o /tmp/.out && grep -q "PAT" /tmp/.out`
chains on curl's exit status, so rc 23 short-circuits the `&&` and the line fails.
The defect was in this prompt's *wording*, which named the status code instead of
the exit code, and in an ad-hoc loop written to satisfy it literally.

Generalised, and it is the same family as everything else this prompt has
accumulated: **a 200 is a claim about the transfer, not about the artefact.** The
green did not depend on the subject. Sibling instances — `! cmd` inert in non-final
bats position (L-628), errexit suppressed in the P-011 gate (T-3203), a `skip` that
reports `ok` (T-3217), a record field correct exactly when redundant (peer 577's
G-069).

The lasting rule is not "use -sf". It is: **when you verify something, know which
number you are reading, and include a control that must fail.** The control is what
caught this — not because it failed, but because it *passed*.

---

## What v5 changes

**Premise 1 was re-measured on the fifth run and had inverted — and the prompt had
been steering by it for two runs.** "STILL DEAD" sent both of them straight to the
arc fallback without ever running the command. Nothing burned down, because the arc
fallback is a decent selector. **That is exactly why it survived: a premise that
fails safe is a premise nobody re-checks.** v3 added the rule that every premise
carries the date and command it was checked with; what v3 did not add was any
reason to *re-run* the command, and a stale premise that quietly degrades selection
produces no symptom to investigate.

The mechanism is worth naming, because it is not "the data changed". The bare
`fw bvp --quadrant hv-hc` still prints *"No tasks have `bvp_scores:` set yet"* —
v3's quote is verbatim and still reproduces. Three lines further down, the same
output says *"Or pass `--include-proposed`…"*. **The premise was measured by
reading the first line of a refusal that named its own escape.** Same family as
v4's `%{http_code}`: the number was real, it was just answering a narrower question
than the one being asked.

**And the correction did not stop at "it works now" — which is the part that
nearly went wrong.** The optional-next-step note written before this run said
quadrant selection was "live again", and had v5 shipped that, it would have traded
a false negative for a false positive: runs would have trusted an ordering that is
a tie-break on rounding. Checking what the command *returns*, rather than that it
returns something, is what caught it — 22 of 23 high-value rows share an identical
value and differ only in the last term of a weighted sum.

The lasting rule generalises past this premise: **when a premise says a capability
is unavailable, re-check it by trying the capability, not by re-reading the error.**
An error message is evidence about one invocation, not about a capability. And when
it turns out to be available, the next question is not "does it return something"
but "is what it returns load-bearing" — those are different measurements, and only
the second one is the reason you wanted the capability.

## Operator notes (not part of the pasted prompt)

**§D — where TermLink earns its place.** Two distinct uses, and v2 conflated them.

*Dispatch* — worth it when the work is *specified* (you can write scope,
deliverable, output format and constraints without first doing the work) and it is
a static scan over finished work. `fw reviewer T-XXX --dispatch` is the canonical
shape. Never dispatch an exploration: measured 0/122 pass rate on inception
dispatches.

*Correspondence* — the chat arc, and it is not chatter. It has produced findings
in both directions across three runs: a peer's P-011 errexit finding (which became
T-3203), a peer's guard-reimplementation class (which sharpened T-3204's mutation
step), and corrections we sent back that they acted on. Read it at the start of
every run; post when you have something measured, not when you have nothing to do.

**On the filing budget.** The budget is not a claim that filings are bad — the v1
run's six filings included two verified defects worth having. It is a claim that
*the ratio is the signal*. Filing three tickets per task landed means the session
found more than it fixed, which is the state the directive was issued to end. When
you hit the budget, that is information for the operator, not an error to route
around. A run that files **zero** is not automatically better, either: v3's run
filed zero and the one thing it might have filed was correctly a Human AC instead,
because it was a decision and not a defect. Know which you have.

**On stopping.** The last line is the one most likely to be violated, because
landing mode creates momentum and the budget gauge is the only thing that
disagrees with it. A run that ends at 85% with a clean handover beats a run that
ends at 97% with uncommitted work — the v1 run finished its last piece at 90% and
had nothing left for the next one.

**On the gauge that enforces that stop (T-3204).** The percentage it reports is a
fraction of `CONTEXT_WINDOW`, which is a **configured cost-and-quality cap**, not
this model's context window. Since T-3204 the messages say so, and
`checkpoint.sh status` names the model the cap is being applied to. So "85%" in
the line above means 85% of the cap, and the cap is a dial the operator sets —
worth knowing before you argue with it.
