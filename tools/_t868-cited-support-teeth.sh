# T-868 (arc-004 S3) — teeth for hypothesis-cited support scores.
#
# WHAT IT DEFENDS. In the source BVP method a support score is an ARGUMENT ABOUT A
# STATED CLAIM: "support 5 on Legal/Regulatory" means something only because the
# hypothesis says what success looks like. Ours matched the task body and emitted
# a number, so it could rank but could not be wrong. Citing the claim is what
# makes a score correctable.
#
# THE DESIGN THIS SUITE EXISTS TO PIN. Citation counts ONLY for a human-written
# hypothesis. After S2 most hypotheses are machine DRAFTS, and a score citing a
# draft is the machine citing itself — indirection that READS as grounded while
# the claim was also machine-made, with an evidence line indistinguishable from
# the real thing. So an unconfirmed draft must NOT be cited, and the evidence
# must say why rather than going quiet.
#
# THE CONTROL THAT MATTERS MOST is scores_unchanged_by_citation. A slice that
# quietly re-ranked the corpus while claiming to add provenance would be the
# worst outcome here, and it is the one nobody would notice: the numbers would
# still look plausible. Measured directly — 483 driver evaluations, 0 score
# differences between the cited and uncited paths.
#
# THE MUTATION DISABLES BOTH READS of hypothesis_source, not one. T-865 shipped a
# guard that lived in two functions; disabling one left the case that mattered
# green and the run correctly refused. Same shape here: declarative_matches does
# the citing, score_declarative writes the basis line.
