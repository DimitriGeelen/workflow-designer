"""T-542 teeth — the cost axis must measure surface, and must decline to guess.

`blast_radius` carries weight 0.6 in the F8 composite (0.6×br + 0.3×tier +
0.1×effort) — the dominant term. Before T-542 it was derived from the task's
`components:` frontmatter alone, and `components:` was EMPTY on 59 of 59
non-completed active tasks here. Every non-inception task therefore scored
br=0 via the `no-components` branch.

That 0 was not a measurement. It was a blind read wearing the cheapest value
on the scale, and the whole cost axis collapsed to `inception ? 3.6 : 1.4`
with 29 of 59 tasks tied at the modal value. An HV/LC filter run over it
promotes on fabric coverage, not on cost — and it does so silently, because a
number is present and looks like every other number.

T-2189 had already recognised the identical shape one population earlier: its
docstring says the count "always returns 0, making inceptions look artificially
cheap", and it repaired inceptions only. The same sentence was true of every
task with an empty `components:`.

This probe defends the four properties that make the repaired axis worth
having, none of which a green `fw bvp estimate-cost all` would reveal:

  1. GRADED     — blast_radius reaches >= 3 distinct non-absent values on the
                  real corpus. Guards the exact binary collapse T-542 fixed;
                  a dominant term with two values is a flag worth 0.6.
  2. HONEST ABSENCE — when nothing is knowable the key is OMITTED, not set to
                  0 and not set to null. `compute_cost` keys off
                  `br is not None`, so an omitted key lands on the existing
                  `source: 'absent'` branch and the task drops OUT of the
                  ranking rather than entering it at the cheapest value.
  3. MEASURED, NOT MENTIONED — a body naming a path that does not exist in the
                  tree must not raise the blast radius. The existence check is
                  the whole difference between a measurement and a word count,
                  and it is what makes a rename stop counting.
  4. DECLARATION WINS — an explicit `components:` list still beats the body
                  scan. The fallback is a fallback; it must not overrule the
                  author.
