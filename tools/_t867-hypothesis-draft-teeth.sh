# T-867 (arc-004) — teeth for hypothesis drafting.
#
# WHAT IT DEFENDS. S1 gates a GO on a hypothesis. Measured before S2 was built: of
# 14 active inceptions, ~11 are delivery-shaped and NONE carried one — so the gate
# alone stands in front of eleven tasks belonging to the person who said writing
# these is hard. The drafter is the ramp.
#
# THE ONE RULE. The drafter must not invent a success clause. A plausible invented
# metric is WORSE than a blank: it satisfies the gate, reads as considered, and
# commits the project to a claim nobody made. So when the task's own text offers
# nothing checkable, the third clause must carry [NEEDS YOU] and S1 must still
# refuse it. The drafter marks the hole; the gate holds the line; neither pretends
# the task is ready.
#
# TWO MUTATIONS, because the two ways of breaking that rule are independent:
#   --mutation            the drafter FABRICATES instead of marking the gap
#   --mutation-fragment   the trailing-stopword filter is removed
#
# The second is not hypothetical. It reproduces a defect this file's subject
# actually shipped for about ten minutes: the raw patterns returned "80% of the",
# a fragment that means nothing but CONTAINS a digit — so S1's gate would have
# accepted it. A drafter manufacturing signals that pass the gate while saying
# nothing is the fabrication failure arriving through a regex instead of through
# invention, and it was caught by looking at the output rather than by reasoning.
