"""Schema validator for AEF Workflow Designer files.

Validates the workflow files produced by the AEF Workflow Designer against the
contract in docs/designer/schema.md (see especially section 7.3 "Validation",
the required-field tables in sections 3/4.1/5/6.1, and the XML mapping in 7.1/7.2).

Two produced formats are supported and auto-detected:

  * YAML canonical form (section 3) -- the AEF-canonical, source-controlled,
    hand-authorable representation. Edges reference node `uid`s (not displayIds).
  * BPMN 2.0 XML export (section 7) -- what the designer's Save action emits.
    Flow references use `bpmn:id` (displayId); `aef:uid` carries stable identity.

This is a STRUCTURAL validator only. It does not execute workflows -- the
`fw workflow run` runtime executor is explicitly out of scope (T-002 scope fence).

Exit codes (AEF audit convention):
    0  valid          -- no findings
    1  warnings only  -- convention issues, still usable
    2  invalid        -- one or more hard-rule errors (or a load failure)

Usage:
    python3 tools/validate-workflow.py <file> [--format {auto,yaml,xml}]
                                              [--json] [--quiet]

Standalone by design (not wired into the vendored `fw` CLI) to respect the
product/framework boundary and Directive 4 (Portability); the framework may
later adopt it as `fw workflow validate`.

# T-875 (arc-005 S1) — the diagram-kind marker AEF proposed as their T-2556 and
# T-213 GO'd on 2026-07-21 (operator-ratified: T-213's [REVIEW] Human AC is
# ticked). It answers ONE question: is this map illustrative, or is it a plan of
# actionable work? Without it nothing in the serialized file distinguishes the
# two, and AEF's `fw bpmn promote` has minted real owner:human tasks from
# documentation nodes (their L-504 / T-2548-9).
#
# CLOSED enum, per T-213 IW-2 — an open vocabulary invites drift, and a third
# value (e.g. an instance marker) can be added additively later without moving a
# pin. ABSENT IS LEGAL AND IS NOT A WARNING, per T-213 IW-3: the default is UNSET
# so the marker stays an explicit author decision and no map is silently
# reclassified by its own tooling.
#
# Frozen-v1 safety, RE-DERIVED under T-875 rather than inherited from T-213 --
# and the reason is not the one the phrase "additive" suggests. `aef:workflowMeta`
# appears ZERO times in docs/standards/aef-bpmn-mapping-v1.md (control: the
# attributes it does classify appear 1-8 times in the same grep shape). The §1
# two-class partition enumerates NODE-level attributes; §6's four conformance
# clauses reach node meta-keys, aef:uid, and presentational no-ops. None of them
# reaches document-level metadata, so this attribute cannot violate them. The
# standard simply has no document-level class -- which is a gap in the standard
# worth reporting to AEF (T-877), not a licence to assume anything else is safe.
#
# Module scope, one copy, read by BOTH forms -- same reasoning as AUTHORITIES
# (T-322): a second copy of a governance vocabulary is how the two forms drift
# apart on the governance question itself.

# reasoning as the T-315 occupancy hoist.
#
# T-331: the collapse is now a TOTAL, EXPLICIT PARTITION of AUTHORITIES across
# three tables. It used to be one table plus a comment saying "external" and
# "none" were "absent here on purpose". Absence cannot carry a decision:
# `AUTHORITY_OWNER.get(a) is None` could not distinguish "the standard defines
# this to produce no task" from "nobody ever decided what this compiles to", and
# both silently SKIPPED the O-1 check rather than satisfying it. The comment
# asserting they were equivalent was answerable to nothing and could not fail.
# See test_validate_iw9.py, which requires the three sets to partition
# AUTHORITIES exactly — so a sixth authority value cannot be admitted to the
# vocabulary without someone stating its compiled outcome.

# omission here is a FALSE POSITIVE — an ERROR reported on a valid document.
#
# This set previously held three entries: laneSet, sequenceFlow, extensionElements.
# Those are the only non-flow-node children OUR OWN emitters produce, so the list was
# complete for the population that wrote it and wrong for BPMN. Found when

# ids, so the finding anchored to a real subject and the T-335 anchorability guard
# stayed green; only the id-less <documentation> produced `node '?'` and made the

# protected the instances that happened to lack it.

#
# The relationship is a TRANSLATION plus a small extension, not "a superset" as
# the T-320 census supposed. Measured over 96 authored BPMN and both emitters:
# the bridge (tools/yaml-to-bpmn.py TYPE_MAP) and the designer (TYPE_TAG,
# src:9230ff) produce EXACTLY the same 10 element names as each other, because
# link and typed events are renamed on the way out — linkEventThrow becomes
# intermediateThrowEvent, and eventError/Timer/Message all become a neutral
# intermediateCatchEvent whose kind rides <aef:eventDef>. So
# intermediateCatchEvent / intermediateThrowEvent are not extra vocabulary; they
# are what the YAML names are CALLED here.
#
# Derived, so adding a YAML node type automatically admits its XML spelling and
# the two forms cannot fall out of step.

# stays a standalone tool with no load-time dependency on the bridge — and

#   boundaryEvent -- attached-event modelling, 2 occurrences in the deliberate
#     fixture tests/fixtures/aef-bpmn/boundary-events.bpmn. Legal BPMN, read by
#     the designer's import path (src:9731 treats it as a catch host), but the
#     editor cannot draw one, so nothing we emit contains it. Admitted rather
#     than reported: refusing it would call a valid diagram invalid.
#
# PL-064 applies to what is NOT here: absence from the corpus is not absence of
# demand. This set is deliberately small and explicit so widening it is a visible
# decision rather than a silent one.
# T-970: plain BPMN `<task>` is ACCEPTED on the XML side.
#
# It was rejected as an unknown element, and that was 94 of 110 findings — 86% — on the
# first corpus we ever validated that we did not author ourselves (aef-greenfield-test,
# 26 maps generated from an OWL ontology and published through POST /api/save on
# designer v0.13.0). We were refusing the base task element of the standard we claim to
# implement.
#
# OUR OWN FROZEN STANDARD SAYS NOT TO. mapping-v1 §3:
#   "a node's `owner` MUST be its lane — there is no node-level `owner` override. The
#    Lane (its `aef:laneMeta authority`) is the sole authority-of-record for who-performs
#    … Task-type (userTask vs service/scriptTask) SHOULD agree with the lane and is
#    PRESENTATIONAL where it does not; the forward-compiler emits a validation WARNING on
#    the mismatch rather than refusing the diagram (O-1: lane wins, warn-not-refuse)."
#
# So a plain `<task>` in an authority-bearing lane has a perfectly derivable owner, and an
# ERROR that refuses the diagram over a presentational property contradicts O-1 directly.
#
# WHY THE MISTAKE WAS EASY: §3's table lists userTask / serviceTask / scriptTask as
# MAPPING ROWS — what each type compiles to — and it reads like an input vocabulary. It is
# not one. XML_ONLY because the YAML form has its own authored type list; nothing here
# changes what the designer emits.

# Occupancy is NOT node height (T-313). The renderer's own containment function

        Predicate, settled jointly with AEF at rail 339 and adopted verbatim:

          For lanes in laneSet DECLARATION order, the y-ranges of nodes grouped
          by DECLARED lane must be strictly ordered and non-overlapping.
          Evaluate only when: >=2 lanes, >=2 lanes populated, and EVERY node
          positioned. Otherwise SKIP (do not pass) — an unevaluable map must
          not report clean.
          Report per violating ADJACENT lane pair, naming the extremal witness
          pair: the upper lane's lowest-drawn node and the lower lane's
          highest-drawn node. Equal y counts as a crossing (two nodes on one
          row cannot be in two bands).
          Distinguish repair shape by crossing counts: 100% of both sides =>
          wholesale inversion => laneSet reorder (zero-semantic). A subset =>
          placement or stale membership on the named nodes => authority call,
          not a layout call.

        The predicate is deliberately ORIGIN-FREE: it never reconstructs band
        boundaries. Do not "improve" it by walking cumulative lane heights from
        POOL_Y + POOL_HEADER the way the renderer does (laneTop/laneAtY) — that
        needs an origin the map does not store, and anchoring at the topmost
        node produced 7 phantom mismatches on AEF's draft-trigger-handling,
        which is clean under this rule (rail 339).

        Adjacent pairs are sufficient: the relation is transitive across
        populated lanes, since each populated group has min <= max.

        Ordering (``_check_lane_geometry``) compares lanes against EACH OTHER and
        is structurally blind to a lane that cannot contain its OWN members. This
        is that rule: a lane whose members' occupancy extent exceeds its declared
        height draws part of itself past the band edge.

        Gated on CONTAINMENT, strict: ``extent > height``. A box whose bottom edge
        lands exactly ON the band edge is contained and does not fire.

        This is DELIBERATELY not the Clean fixpoint
        ``height == extent + 2*LANE_FIT_MARGIN``. A lane that contains its content
        while missing the fixpoint is one Clean away from tidy, not broken, and
        (AEF, rail 341) "a lint that reports tidiness as breakage trains people to
        ignore it". Tidiness is the mapMessiness nudge's job (T-102), not this
        rule's. Our two toolchains therefore agree exactly, including on the lanes
        they both decline to report — the divergence is pinned by a test so a
        future "consistency fix" has to delete a named case to happen.

        Occupancy, not height, and the lowest node is found by botOf rather than
        by y: AEF's fixture has a gateway at y=199 reaching 265 and a task at
        y=200 reaching 264, so a largest-y sort names the wrong node, and their
        live session-lifecycle case has a gateway as its lowest member.

        Composition with the ordering rule, which is why this runs second: bands
        tile the axis contiguously in declaration order, so heights are the only
        free variable. A set of heights that contains every lane exists iff the
        lanes' member extents are already ordered and non-overlapping — i.e. iff
        lane_geometry is clean. So on an ordering-clean map this is repairable
        with zero node movement, and on an ordering-dirty one it is not
        repairable by heights at all.
