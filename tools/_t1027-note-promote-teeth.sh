# _t1027-note-promote-teeth.sh — `fw note promote` links an observation to the task it became.
#
# WHY (T-912, erased silently by the 1.7.740 re-vendor; found by the T-1020 census): promote wrote
# the literal string `promoted_to: task` — never an id — so nothing linked an observation to the
# task it turned into; it ignored create-task's exit code, so a failed creation still marked the
# observation promoted; and it created every task as owner: human, which the delegation surface
# then counts as a decision only the operator can close.
#
# Legs, on a scratch project driven through the real CLI (hermetic):
#   1. promoted_to records the created task id (T-NNNN), not the constant `task`
#   2. the created task carries `observation: OBS-NNN` (the reverse link)
#   3. the created task's owner is agent by default; --owner human is honoured
#   4. when task creation fails, the observation stays pending (not promoted to nothing)
# Exit 0 = all legs pass, 1 = a leg fails, 2 = cannot run.
