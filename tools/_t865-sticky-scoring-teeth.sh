# T-865 — teeth for automatic inception scoring with STICKY human overrides.
#
# WHAT IT DEFENDS. Operator direction 2026-09-26: rank everything automatically,
# take the human out of scoring — "but if I want to override it then it should
# not be overwritten by an automatic ranking". Sticky is what makes repeated
# auto-scoring safe: if a re-score can paint over a judgement call, re-scoring
# is destructive, nobody runs it often, and the estimates never improve.
#
# THE FAILURE THAT MATTERS IS SILENT. A sticky guard that stops working looks
# exactly like one that works, until someone notices their overrides have been
# quietly erased for weeks. Two consequences for this file:
#   - `bytes_unchanged` asserts the FILE, not just the returned dict. A guard
#     that reports "protected" while the writer rewrites the value anyway would
#     satisfy any check that only reads the return value.
#   - `protection_is_reported` asserts the count reaches the operator. An
#     unreported guard is an unverifiable one, which is the whole thesis of the
#     arc this task sits in.
#
# MUTATION. Stripping the `src == "human"` branch must kill every sticky case
# while the control cases — which do not depend on it — stay green. Controls
# going red means the mutant is broken rather than blind, and every red in that
# run is false; that is reported as MUTATION SETUP BROKEN rather than read as a
# clean kill (the mistake T-849 actually made).

# controls, because "the file is never rewritten" is still worth pinning — it
