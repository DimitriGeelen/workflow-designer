T-525 teeth — does the fabric coverage WARN actually discriminate, or just warn?

The check being exercised warned unconditionally on `unregistered > 0` and printed raw counts.
That is why no leg here may assert merely "a fabric warning appeared": the pre-change code
satisfies that for free, on every run, for every input. The deliverable is the DISCRIMINATION —
card loss must read differently from source growth — so every leg pins which branch was taken
and, where it asserts a branch was NOT taken, also proves the check was reached at all.

That second half is L-from-T-524, learned the hard way one task ago: a negative assertion is
satisfied by silence. "The output does not say CARD LOSS" passes when there is no output, which
is precisely the broken-audit case such a leg exists to catch. So legs 3 and 5 additionally
require the coverage line to be present and well-formed.

History is controlled through FABRIC_HISTORY_DIR (a seam the audit declares) rather than by
writing fabricated audit reports into the live `.context/audits/`. Fabricating real-looking
reports in the tree to test a check that reads reports is how you end up with a fixture nobody
recognises six weeks later — and a crashed run leaves it behind.

WHERE EACH LEG RUNS (T-549). The branch legs no longer audit THIS repository, and the reason
is cost that grows on its own. Five full `fw audit --sections structure` runs cost 86.04s
against _t509's 90s cap (T-543), and profiling one run (16.86s) found the three most expensive
checks to be BVP coherence 3.93s, the tracked-tree secret scan 3.69s, and the concerns walk
2.56s — 60% of the run, and not one of them can depend on FABRIC_HISTORY_DIR. The four branch
runs were paying for a whole-repository audit to vary a single input that one check reads.
Worse, that price tracks the tree: 254 watched files today and climbing, so raising the cap
would have bought headroom the repo consumes again.

So the four branch runs use PROJECT_ROOT — a seam the framework already declares and its own
cron entries already use — pointed at a freshly built fixture of 20 watched files and 8 cards.
This is a REAL `fw audit` process running the REAL check through the REAL code path; what
changed is the tree it walks, not the thing under test. 16.86s -> ~1.5s each.

What that must not cost, and what keeps it honest:
  - Leg 1 still audits THIS repository. "The check is reached and its arithmetic is right"
    is a claim about here, and a fixture cannot make it.
  - Leg 6a is STRONGER on the fixture than it was on the real tree. It asserts severity is
    invariant across branches, and on the real tree an unrelated check flapping mid-run (cron,
    a concurrent agent, a handover commit) moved the warn count for reasons having nothing to
    do with the branch — the same class of defect T-533 fixed in leg 7. On the fixture, history
    is the only thing that varies, so a difference in the count means what the leg says it does.
  - The standing risk is now fixture drift: a fixture cannot notice a branch the real tree
    reaches and it does not. Leg 1 covers the reachability half. The other half is
    tools/_t549-fabric-coverage-mutation-teeth.py, which mutates the audit's coverage branch
    and requires these legs to go RED — because a cheaper stimulus that can no longer fail is
    not a cheaper test, it is a deleted one (PL-206).

Legs:
  1  the check is REACHED on THIS repo and reports a ratio, not just a difference (guards 3/5)
  2  history showing MORE cards than now → the CARD LOSS branch, with the arithmetic right
  3  history showing FEWER cards than now → the growth branch, NOT card loss, and the line exists
  4  history equal to now → the flat branch, which is the case that says "the unregistered
     movement you are looking at is tree growth, not carding"
  5  no usable history → ABSTAINS. "I have no prior value" must not render as "no change"
     (PL-205), and must not silently fall into any of the three comparison branches.
  6a severity is UNCHANGED across all four branches on the fixture.
  6b the coverage finding on THIS repo is carried at WARN. The operator's T-344 [REVIEW]
     accepted this warning; a reporting fix that quietly promoted it to FAIL would overturn
     that decision under cover of a cosmetic change. Asserted on the FINDING's own severity
     rather than on the repo's total Fail count, which is a global moving property that would
     make this leg go red for somebody else's unrelated failure (G-015).
  7  hermetic — the SUBJECT'S WRITE-SET is byte-identical after the run (scoped, T-533).

Exit 0 all legs pass, 1 a leg failed, 2 REFUSE (the audit did not produce a coverage line at
all — nothing was evaluated, and that is not a pass).
