# runme-signal.sh — runme.sh tells the agent what it is doing, as it happens (832 T-1003).
#
# SOURCE IT from every runme.sh, right after the log is set up:
#     . "$PROJ/tools/runme-signal.sh"; runme_signal_init "T-988 land upgrade" "$LOG"
#     runme_signal step "1/2 confirmed: pristine commit"
#     runme_signal step "1/2 done: $(git rev-parse --short HEAD)"
# runme_signal_init installs an EXIT trap that records `done rc=0` or `STOPPED rc=N` however the
# script ends (fail(), Ctrl-C, a crash), so the agent hears about a stop even when no line says so.
#
# WHY. The operator runs runme.sh from a plain command prompt; the agent only acts when something
# wakes it. A message alone does not (a sidecar inbox is read at the next prompt). So each event
# is one short line, written two ways, and the agent keeps tools/runme-watch.sh armed in the
# background, which exits on the first new line and so wakes it:
#   1. appended to .context/working/runme.events   (local, always works)
#   2. posted to TermLink topic runme-832           (durable, visible to Watchtower and other
#      agents, works across hosts; best effort)
# Neither may slow or break the script: the TermLink post runs detached with a 5 s timeout, and
# every failure is swallowed — a missing hub costs nothing but the second copy.
#
# Line format:  <utc-iso> <run-id> <event> <text>     event: started | step | done | STOPPED

# The project root comes from THIS file's location, not the caller's cwd: the 0.15.3 release was run
# from another directory and its events reached the topic but not this file (2026-10-03).
