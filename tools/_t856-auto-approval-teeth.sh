# T-856 — teeth for the operator-ruled BVP auto-approval switch.
#
# WHAT IT DEFENDS. The operator ruled on 2026-09-25 that BVP scoring happens
# without approval. The implementation opens exactly ONE of the five verbs
# acd_gate guards. The failure mode to defend against is not "the switch does not
# work" — that is obvious on first use — it is "the switch opened more than it was
# asked to". A blanket CLAUDECODE bypass would satisfy every happy-path check and
# would silently hand an agent policy-edit authority over the value model.
#
# ON MUTATION MODE. The usual pattern here strips the feature from a COPY of the
# subject and requires the dependent cases to go red. lib/bvp.sh is SOURCED by
# bin/fw, so substituting a copy means repointing FRAMEWORK_ROOT, which changes
# far more than the thing under test and would produce reds for the wrong reason
# — the exact trap measured in T-849. So the treatment/control comparison here is
# the SWITCH STATE (FW_BVP_AUTO_CONFIRM=1 vs =0) against the same source, plus the
# four still-gated verbs as the control set. That is a weaker mutation than a
# source strip and is labelled as such rather than dressed up as one.
