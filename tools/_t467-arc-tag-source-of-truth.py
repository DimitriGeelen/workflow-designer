"""T-467: `fw arc tag` must write the source-of-truth field, not the deprecated one.

T-1849 made task-side `arc_id:` canonical. T-1850 MIGRATED 162 tasks off the
`tags: [arc:<slug>]` form. `fw arc tag` — the command `fw arc --help` names as the
way to record membership — kept writing the tag and never the field, so every call
re-created what the migration had cleaned up, one task at a time.

Nothing broke visibly, which is why it lasted: every reader takes the UNION of both
forms, so an arc recorded in two representations RENDERS IDENTICALLY to one recorded
in one. T-466 caught it only because a verification leg asserted the field by NAME
instead of asserting the rendered output looked right.

BOTH ARMS ARE DRIVEN. The cheap way to stop a writer emitting the wrong field is to
stop it emitting anything, so "writes arc_id:" is load-bearing next to "does not
write the tag" — a verb gutted to a no-op passes the second arm perfectly.

Every case runs `fw arc tag` for real against a THROWAWAY project root: its own
.tasks/ and .context/arcs/. Nothing here touches the live corpus.

Run with --against-head to execute the SAME arms against HEAD's pre-fix copy of
lib/arc.sh. Arms that pass there are not fencing anything.

Exit 0 all arms behaved, 1 any arm did not.
